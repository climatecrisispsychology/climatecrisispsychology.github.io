    "text": "1.1 Introduction\n\n“It is now incontrovertible that human behavior has led to significant changes in the Earth’s climate, and that these changes will inflict an increasingly significant toll on human wellbeing if they are not reversed. It is also clear that both the opportunities and obstacles to the needed changes are largely psychological and behavioral.”\n\nSo began the syllabus for a course that Noah Goodman and I taught together in the Spring Quarter of 2023 at Stanford, titled “Psychology of the Climate Crisis”. We had discussed teaching such a class for several years, and finally had the chance to do it this year. The group of students in the class ended up being quite small, with four undergradates, two Master’s students, and two PhD students, hailing from six different departments across the university. Fortunately, these were amongst the most engaged and dedicated students that we have ever taught in our entire careers. The small size of the class also allowed us to get to know the students very well and give them more agency in designing the class.\nThe goal of this post is to catalog our experiences in teaching this class, in hopes that they might inspire others to teach similar courses."

    "text": "1.2 Syllabus\nSince neither of us had any expertise in climate psychology, we decided to work together with the students to put together the syllabus; in essence they got to experience the same kind of educational journey that we did. The overall structure and set of topics that we ultimately covered was decided in the first class session, based on a starting set of topics derived primarily from our reading of the 2009 APA Report on Psychology and Global Climate Change.\nThe other major event of the first week was a talk to the class by Adam Aron, who happened to be visiting campus that week. Adam has been at the forefront of advocacy around the climate crisis, and has recently written a very nice book on the topic, which includes a substantial amount of discussion around relevant psychological issues.\nThe first session of each week (Tuesday) was dedicated to student-led discussion of papers regarding the week’s subtopic. The students were also responsible for selecting the papers. Because of the small number of students in the class, we assigned the leadership of the discussion each Tuesday to one or two students. The second session each week was dedicated to working on the final project (discussed below) or to wide-ranging discussions of relevant topics.\n\n\n\nWeek\nTopic\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n1\nOverview and introductory talk by Adam Aron\n\n\n\n2\nPerceiving and understanding risk and uncertainty\nWeber (2006), Zaval et al., 2014)\n\n\n3\nIntertemporal choice and future-oriented thinking\nMaiella et al. (2020), Kim & Ahn (2019)\n\n\n4\nBeliefs about climate change: Susceptibility to misinformation and motivated reasoning\nDruckman & McGrath (2019), Hart & Nisbet (2012)\n\n\n5\nBehavior change\nBamberg et al. (2015), Goldberg et al. (2020)\n\n\n6\nPersonal and group identity\nDoell et al (2021), Grindal et. al (2023)\n\n\n7\nCooperation and social norms\nLatkin, et al. (2021) , Constantino, et al. (2022)\n\n\n8\nCollective behavior (game theory / networks)\nTavoni and Iris (2020) , Diaz et al., (2012)\n\n\n9\nPsychological interventions to address climate change\nBergquist et al. (2023), Dietz et al. (2009)\n\n\n10\nWrapup\n\n\n\n\nWith only ten weeks there were a number of topics that we were not able to cover. One important one, which is the focus of recent work by Adam Aron and colleagues, is the psychology of collective action; that is, what are the psychological factors that drive people to become involved in larger groups and ultimately to become activists. Another important topic that we didn’t touch upon is the psychological impacts of climate change, though this topic came up often in our discussions."

    "text": "1.3 Class project: An open-source book\nIn planning the class Russ floated the somewhat off-the-wall idea of having the students work together to generate an open source e-book as their final project. He had done this once before and thought the students found it quite fulfilling to generate a resource that will live beyond the end of the quarter.\nIn the first few weeks we discussed the chapter topics (which aligned roughly with the syllabus topics), and the students worked together to identify potential synergies and overlaps between their intended topics. In Week 5 students submitted a one-page topic proposal with proposed references, which were peer-reviewed by other students as well as by the instructors. An initial draft of the chapter was due in Week 8, which were also peer reviewed, and the final draft was due during Finals Week (Week 11). The chapters will be edited by the instructors over the summer and will be released as an open-source book later this summer."

    "title": "1  Teaching the Psychology of the Climate Crisis",
    "section": "1.4 Major takeaways",
    "text": "1.4 Major takeaways\nA first takeaway for us was reframing where the problem really lies. Russ went into the course thinking about climate change as primarily a problem of behavior change, just like the many other habits that he wrote about in his book, Hard to Break. He still thinks that the stickiness of behavior is a central problem, but is less convinced that an understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying this stickiness is actually useful for understanding how to actually address the climate crisis. Instead, he has become increasingly convinced that the most important psychological levers are social, particularly regarding social norms. The paper from our syllabus by Constantino et al (2022) lays this out nicely. This is also fairly clear from the meta-analysis of intervention effects by Bergquist et al., 2023, which showed that inerventions based on social comparison had the largest effects.\nSecond, we are less convinced after the class that psychological interventions are going to be an important part of the solution, even though psychological research is clearly important for understanding the important levers for intervention. This in part driven by the empirical evidence from the aforementoined large second-order meta-analysis by Berquist et al., (2023), which showed that the effects of psychological interventions were moderate at best, and became quite small after bias correction. More importantly, we think that making major changes in behavior is going to require large-scale social norm changes; in particular, in the context of the US, massive changes in behavior could occur relatively quickly if Republican leaders were to begin advocating for the importance of action to address the climate crisis and thus changing social norms within their community. Given the existing evidence regarding psychological interventions, it’s just not clear to me that they offer any hope on their own of addressing the climate crisis in the near term. We should note that the work on collective action mentioned above may provide useful interventions that could have larger impacts than those targeted at the individual.\nAn important new concept that one of us (RP) learned about in the class is pluralistic ignorance, which is the idea that a group of individuals can systematically misunderstand what others in their group believe. In the context of climate change, a compelling example comes from Gregg Sparkman and colleagues, who found:\n\n“80–90% of Americans underestimate the prevalence of support for major climate change mitigation policies and climate concern. While 66–80% Americans support these policies, Americans estimate the prevalence to only be between 37–43% on average. Thus, supporters of climate policies outnumber opponents two to one, while Americans falsely perceive nearly the opposite to be true.”\n\nIt’s very clear that this kind of systematic misunderstanding is a serious impediment to any kind of climate action at the national level. Unfortunately it’s less clear how we fix this problem.\nNoah raised another important takeaway: Climate change is a case study for “psychology in the wild” that helps bring together many different psychological issues that are often studied in different subfields. A few examples would include: behavioral decision making, game theory, intertemporal choice, belief updating, behavior change, and social norms. Thinking about the larger topic of climate change required bringing all of these together in a way that was quite illuminating for both of us.\nFinally, we must mention the methodological issues within the literature that we read. Our class discussions of the readings tended heavily towards deep dives into the methodology of each study (perhaps not surprisingly given the instructors), and many of the empirical studies we examined had fairly significant methodological shortcomings. In a number of cases there were methodological choices made that were non-standard and not well motivated, which for me evokes a sense of p-hacking. In fact, there is evidence for at least some degree of p-hacking in this literature from the p-curve analysis presented by Bergquist et al in the meta-analysis. Figure D from Appendix B shows the bump in p-values just below .05 that would be expected if researchers were exploiting analytic variability in order to find a signficant effect:\n\nIt was also disappointing that few of the studies shared their data and none (to my memory) of the empirical studies we read were pre-registered. There was also a particularly heavy use of mediation analysis in this literature, which is problematic for reasons outlined by Julia Rohrer and colleagues (and recently described by Richard Mcelreath as a “dumpster fire”). I hope that as methodological standards in the field increase that this area will come along, but at present the poor methodological standards in the published work make it difficult to form very strong conclusions.\nWe hope this overview is helpful for those of you who are thinking of teaching on the climate crisis. Despite the challenges that I outlined above, both of us found this to be a notably fulfilling teaching experience, due in large part to the passion that our students felt around the topic. We also hope that if you do research or teach on this topic that you will consider contributing to our open source book, to help make it a more robust resource for people interested in the topic.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

    "section": "2.1 Part I: Introduction to Collective Behavioral Engagement",
    "text": "2.1 Part I: Introduction to Collective Behavioral Engagement\n\n2.1.1 Chapter Rationale: The Case for Collective Behaviors\nAs articulated in the previous chapter [1], there is now consensus that climate solutions will require revamping system-wide policies, practices, and infrastructure in order to change our global energy usage (IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, 2022; Rees & Bamberg, 2014). Individuals who do not have special access to high-level decision-making can only catalyze this change by engaging in collective initiatives — behaviors or policies designed to alter broad public processes outside of themselves.\nBorrowing from Stern’s (2000) widely-used taxonomy of environmental behavior, private-sphere environmentalism focuses on personal, household, and consumer behaviors, such as recycling, carpooling, home weatherization, dietary changes, travel reduction, etc. The most effective private-sphere behaviors are addressed in Chapter X ({Ariella’s}). These stand in contrast to public-sphere behaviors, which seek to target collective decision-making, whether at the local, corporate, or governmental level. For any given individual, this could include engagement with policy (such as climate policy support, pro-climate voting, and contacting elected officials) and/or engagement in groups (such as participation in climate initiatives, group organizing, or collective protest).\nWhile individual behavior and collective action are not mutually exclusive, there is reason to carefully choose which to prioritize. Research on “single-action bias” shows that people often take one action to alleviate feelings of concern, and they often neglect taking further steps that would be incrementally protective (Weber, 1997). It is thought that the first action is often enough to pacify one’s affective feelings of worry, irrespective of the behavior’s relative effectiveness. Thus, mis-prioritizing effort in the private-sphere domain could be considered a large opportunity cost, when the alternative might be channeling energy into collective initiatives that would reduce emissions at scale.\nPrivate-sphere behaviors may have a different psychological profile than public-sphere behaviors. Behaviors in each sphere typically load onto different psychometric factors, and different psychological predictors are associated with each (Stern, 2000). For example, in their data, Hall and colleagues (2018) showed that private-sphere actions were more likely to be endorsed by climate skeptics, whereas policy changes were more likely to be endorsed by climate believers. They also showed that private-sphere behaviors were weakly associated with public-sphere behaviors and policy support, with pro-environmental behaviors only correlating with support for various climate policies between r = -.08 to .19 (Hall et al., 2018). It is also worth noting that private sphere behaviors also often depend more on the affordances of one’s environment (e.g., the availability of public transport).\nThus, this chapter seeks to identify the state of psychological science on predictors of engagement in collective climate action. Note that terms such as “collective engagement”, “collective action”, and “public-sphere behavior” will be used interchangeably throughout the chapter, and they refer to any variable measuring either policy support or actions designed to alter broad public processes beyond the individual.\n\n\n2.1.2 Chapter Scope and Approach\nThis chapter reviews any scientific articles since 2015 which measured policy support or public-sphere behaviors that (a) related to climate change specifically, not environmentalism more generally, (b) were measured in terms of current willingness, prospective intentions, or past measured actions, and (c) were assessed in relation to other psychological2 constructs. Because there are relatively few papers that focus explicitly on public-sphere behaviors, we included samples drawn from countries besides the U.S.\nDespite perhaps weaker or indirect significance, we chose to include papers that measured mere behavioral willingness or intention, because influential theories of behavior change (e.g., the theory of planned behavior; Azjen, 1991) suggest that the biggest and most proximal predictor of someone’s behavior is their intention to execute it. This is mirrored in some findings from the climate behavior literature as well (Bamberg et al., 2015). However, it is also true that empirical predictors of actual behavior are almost invariably weaker than predictors of behavioral intentions (Hornsey et al., 2016). Therefore, if both behavioral intentions and actual behaviors were measured, we only synthesized the findings for actual behaviors, unless the findings were contradictory in a useful or telling way.\nIf the method used by the original authors made it impossible to separate private and public sphere behaviors in their analysis, we did not synthesize these results3. Our goal was to be as empirically precise as possible, and we did not want to presume psychological equivalence of public- and private-sphere behaviors, in light of the differences described previously.\nWhere meta-analyses were available, we generally interpreted these results (while noting any concerns with methodological rigor and publication bias) and did not review its constituent studies. Studies conducted after the meta-analysis were still reviewed.\nFinally, across all empirical papers, we opted to only interpret bivariate correlations, as opposed to multiple regression coefficients or mediation results. Our rationale was threefold. (1) Interpreting raw correlations facilitates consistent comparison across studies. Since some authors control for different covariates, interpreting beta coefficients is less standardized. (2) Many of the predictor variables measured in this literature are closely correlated, causing some to soak up more variance than others in an uninterpretable way. (3) If a relationship between two variables is only revealed through indirect mediation (with no direct correlation), this variable is unlikely to be the biggest lever for practitioners to pull in the real world. (4) It is impossible to determine if a mediation finding is causally structured in the implied way, without experimental control or longitudinal sampling."

    "section": "2.2 Part II: What is Known",
    "text": "2.2 Part II: What is Known\nBefore describing take-aways from the literature, we want to caution that skepticism should be applied to the synthesized findings that follow. While reassuring to find some consistent trends across papers, several limitations exist in the existing research. For example, there is a lot of heterogeneity in the way that the same constructs are measured across different papers. Such constructs are often measured with ad-hoc, unvalidated scales that make comparison difficult. Additionally, most work relies on cross-sectional data, which give us no way of understanding causal structures, and third-variable explanations are abundant. Finally, some papers use modest sample sizes (N &lt;250), which are more likely to have noisy or spurious results, and we have not assessed potential publication bias across the literature. Few papers were pre-registered or provided access to replication data.\n\n2.2.1 Theoretical work\nAlthough the focus of this chapter is empirical work, it would not be complete without mention of the theories of collective engagement that have shaped construct formation and measurement. The purpose of this section is to provide context for why the same particular constructs appear repeatedly in the literature. Most of them arose from the earliest theorizing about behavior change, which has been built upon for decades. Although these constructs arguably pack a lot of explanatory power, they also potentially present the dilemma of looking for one’s keys under the streetlamp. In other words, just because these variables repeatedly appear in the literature does not necessarily mean that they are the most important or most relevant.\nSIMCA, EMISCA, and SIMPEA are the models that have arguably inspired most of the recent validations and replications, both in the environmental domain and outside of it.\n\n2.2.1.1 SIMCA, EMISCA, and SIMPEA\nThe Social Identity Model of Collective Action (SIMCA) developed out of a meta-analysis of 182 effects of three variables—perceived injustice, group efficacy, and group identity—which had formed the core pillars of prior research and theorizing on collective action, mostly outside of the domain of climate. Finding significant effects of all three variables, van Zomeren et al. (2008) proposed an overarching model combining them together and proposing that: collective action occurs when people identify with a group, which causes them to experience a shared sense of injustice, group-based affect, and collective efficacy.\nThe Encapsulation Model of the Social Identity of Collective Action (EMISCA), proposed by Thomas et al. (2012), is nearly identical to SIMCA, except that it reverses the causal order implied. In EMISCA, it is the perceptions of unfair treatment, combined with beliefs that collective participation will be effective, that cause someone to become socially identified with their group, thus spurring action on behalf of the group. In either case, the key variables contributed and highlighted by these models are collective efficacy, perceived injustice, affect, and social identification.\nThe social identity model of pro-environmental action (SIMPEA) was proposed by Fritsche et al. (2018) as an extension of previous models, adding that group-based environmental action is partly determined by perceptions of in-group pro-environmental norms and goals.\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Foundational Frameworks\nThe models above were built upon prior theorizing from the five or so other foundational frameworks, described below.\nPerhaps most influentially, social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) identifies collective action as a behavior only undertaken by group members. In this framework, a salient group identity is the cornerstone of collective action, by which an individual is willing to take actions on behalf of their group. Based on 64 studies, Van Zomeren et al. (2008) reported in their meta-analysis a correlation of r =.38 between identification with the in-group and collective action.\nResource mobilization (McCarthy & Zald, 1997) has also garnered attention from collective action researchers. This is the idea that individuals join groups when they perceive the group has mobilized enough resources to accomplish its aims. This led to the introduction of variables like collective efficacy. Based on 53 studies, Van Zomeren et al. (2008) reported a meta-analytic effect size of r =.34 for the relationship between collective efficacy and collective action.\nIntergroup emotions theory (Smith, 1993; Mackie et al., 2008) spotlights the key role of emotions in driving group-based behavior. According to this theory, group-based emotions are generated specifically as a result of one’s identification as a group member (e.g., pride, anger, guilt), and it propels behaviors on behalf of the group.Van Zomeren et al. (2008) report an average effect of group-based affect on collective behavior across 65 studies, r = .35.\nThe theory of planned behavior change, by Azjen (1991), posits that behaviors are directly preceded by behavioral intentions, and that behavioral intentions are influenced by three interdependent variables: attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms about the behavior, and perceived behavioral control. Together, Azjen viewed that these could account for much of the variance in behavior.\nFinally, the cost-benefit rational actor model, put forth by Olson (1965), suggests that free-riding is the most common outcome when there is a limited collective good. Thus, active participation in collective action is more likely if it is associated with benefits only obtainable through participation: such motives can include collecting the benefits of collective action goal, normative motives, and reward motives.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Empirical and Qualitative Work\nThe subsections below synthesize findings from psychological articles since 2015 that include measurement of collective climate engagement, either in the form of intention, behavior, or policy support. The section is organized around common themes—constructs that have been measured repeatedly across multiple papers. Note that all but two articles (one experimental and one qualitative) are cross-sectional.\n\n2.2.2.1 Personal and collective efficacy beliefs\nSix cross-sectional papers and one qualitative article addressed some form of efficacy in relation to collective action. Definitionally: personal efficacy refers to one’s belief that one is capable of having a positive impact in a group; collective efficacy refers to one’s belief that a particular group in question (or sometimes, groups in general) is capable of achieving its ends or making a difference.\nPersonal Efficacy. Personal efficacy was positively associated with collective behavior across five cross-sectional studies, ranging from r = .33-.62 (Bamberg et al., 2015; Furlong & Vignoles, 2021; Hornsey & Fielding, 2016; Gulliver et al., 2023; van Zomeren et al., 2019). Two of these papers measured self-reports of actual recent behavior among samples of individuals who were active in some type of environmental activism (Furlong & Vignoles, 2021; Gulliver et al., 2023), and both of these studies reported medium effect sizes of r = .33-.54. In open-ended responses, personal efficacy was frequently spontaneously mentioned as a reason why some people take on more activities (Gulliver et al., 2023). In a separate study of semi-structured interviews with four environmentally engaged individuals, one emergent theme was that these individuals felt simultaneously accomplished and indispensable within their initiatives, while soberly doubtful about the extent of their impact on climate change as a whole (Bührle & Kimmerle, 2021).\nCollective Efficacy. Collective efficacy was positively associated with collective behavior in six studies, and not significant in one, with the significant effect sizes ranging from r = .19-.64 (Bamberg et al., 2015; Furlong & Vignoles, 2021; Gulliver et al., 2023; Rees & Bamberg, 2014; Sabherwal et al., 2021; van Zomeren et al., 2019). Of these studies, four measured hypothetical intentions as the outcome variable (Bamberg et al., 2015; Rees & Bamberg, 2014; Sabherwal et al., 2021; van Zomeren, 2019), and these generally had larger effect sizes (rs = .27-.64). The two studies that examined the relationship between collective efficacy and self-reported actual past behaviors ranged in effect size from not significant to r = .19-.24 (Furlong & Vignoles, 2021; Gulliver et al., 2023). In Bührle & Kimmerle’s (2021) analysis of semi-structured interviews, expectations of collective self-efficacy were spontaneously noted as important when deciding to pursue some form of engagement in the cause.\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Perceived behavioral control\nPerceived behavioral control (PBC) refers to whether someone is capable of taking on activities based on their personal bandwidth (i.e., work schedule, childcare responsibilities, finances, opportunities for engagement in one’s environment, etc.). On surveys, it is often asked in terms of “how much control” someone has over whether they can participate.\nThis construct was addressed in two cross-sectional studies we found. PBC was positively associated with collective action, ranging from r = .19-.61. This relationship was weaker but still significant in the study that measured past actual behaviors (Gulliver et al., 2023) compared to the study that measured hypothetical intentions (Bamberg et al., 2015). In open-ended responses from participants, Gulliver and colleagues (2023) found that individuals most frequently reported PBC-related constraints as the main obstacle to taking on more involvement. These authors also collected data on the participants’ number of children, and having more children was associated with performing on fewer climate leadership actions (r = .15), which is consistent with a time-constraint account of PBC.\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Identity 4\nIdentity can encompass many aspects of an individual’s self-concept, but in this literature, it is typically conceived of as either someone’s identification with a particular group or identification with nature. See Chapter X for a more comprehensive review of identity-related research.\nGroup-based Identity. Schulte et al. (2020) meta-analyzed 15 studies in which opinion-based social identity (e.g., identification with the environmental movement) was assessed as a predictor of participation in collective action, finding a significant correlation of r = 0.56. Two subsequent papers measuring identification with a particular group found it to be significantly positively related to collective engagement, as measured by actual behaviors, with correlations ranging from r = .23-.40 (Furlong & Vignoles, 2021; Gulliver et al., 20235). One caveat is that Gulliver and colleagues (2023) did not find this effect when looking at low-commitment participation, but only high-investment leadership activities. In open-ended responses, group commitment was frequently mentioned as a reason why volunteers choose to take on more activities (Gulliver et al., 2023). Additionally, Bührle and Kimmerle (2021) noted, based on their interviews of four engaged individuals, that their participants had “strongly internalized their group membership” and had developed a sense of project ownership and group solidarity.\nIdentification with Nature. With respect to identification with nature, there is a significant positive correlation with collective engagement, ranging from r =.10-.41. A meta-analysis of 75 correlational studies and 17 experimental studies summarized all empirical work prior to 2019 (Mackay & Schmitt, 2019) and found an effect size of r = .36 for the cross-sectional papers and r = .10 (d = .21) for the experimental papers, after accounting for publication bias. A recent cross-sectional study, published after this meta-analysis, found that environmental identity was associated with low-commitment participatory behavior (r =.25) and high-commitment leadership behavior (r =.41), measured in terms of past actual behavior (Gulliver et al., 2023).\nLastly, one article included a measure of global identification (i.e., identification with humanity) and found a non-significant correlation with past reported behaviors in their environmental group (Furlong & Vignoles, 2021).\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Affect\nIn this literature, affect is typically measured as the extent to which the participant feels specific emotions when thinking about the climate crisis. The most commonly studied emotions are anger, worry, hope, and guilt. Generally, anger and worry have the most robust correlations with collective engagement, summarized below.\nAnger. Across four cross-sectional papers reporting on anger, all found significant positive correlations between anger and collective intentions or behaviors, r = .15-.50 (Bamberg et al., 2015; Furlong & Vignoles, 2021; Rees & Bamberg, 2014; van Zomeren et al., 2019). Only Furlong & Vignoles (2021) examined real behaviors as an outcome, and they report a correlation coefficient of r =.23. From their qualitative interviews, Bührle & Kimmerle (2021) found that participants reported anger as being highly motivating initially, but fading over time in importance.\nWorry. Three cross-sectional papers examined worry or anxiety, with mixed results. Furlong & Vignoles (2021) found no relationship between fear and self-reported behaviors among Extinction Rebellion members. On the other hand, Goldberg et al. (2021) found a significant positive association between fear and climate policy support (no r value available), and Hornsey & Fielding (2016) found a strong correlation between anxiety and self-reported public-sphere action likelihood, r = .56. These results may be compatible, given that they measure different outcome variables. Policy support and behavioral intentions require less active engagement than actual behaviors typically performed by Extinction Rebellion members, so it may be that those who have severe climate anxiety are reluctant to engage more directly. Among the four climate activists who provided semi-structured interviews, their fear reportedly increased over the time (Bührle & Kimmerle (2021).\nRisk Perceptions. Following evidence that risk perceptions are driven by affect processes as much as (or perhaps more than) analytic processes, paired with the close conceptual proximity to worry or fear, I include papers on risk perception here (Weber, 2006). Four papers found positive correlations, r = .63-.66. Two papers found a positive relationship between the perception of future harm and climate policy support, with r =.63 (no r value available for one article) (Goldberg et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2019). Two papers also found a positive relationship between concern about climate risks and behavioral willingness, with r = .66 (again, no r value available for one paper) (Hall et al., 2018; Latkin et al., 2021).\nHope. Hope was measured by three studies, with mixed results. In two studies, it was not correlated with public-sphere behaviors (Furlong & Vignoles, 2021; Hornsey & Fielding, 2016). With respect to behavioral intentions, two studies found significant associations of r = .26-.27 (Furlong & Vignoles, 2021; van Zomeren et al., 2019), while the third found null results (Hornsey & Fielding, 2016). It is worth considering whether hope is already embedded within the construct of collective efficacy, or whether it merits separate evaluation.\nGuilt. Guilt was measured by three cross-sectional studies, which together suggest a positive correlation with intentions, but not actual behavior. Rees & Bamberg (2014) and Hornsey and Fielding (2016) both found significant positive correlations between guilt/shame and collective behavioral intentions (r = .26 and .48, respectively). Furlong & Vignoles (2021) also found a positive correlation when measuring behavioral intentions. However, when the same participants reported their actual past actions, there was no correlation with their feelings of guilt (Furlong & Vignoles, 2021). Guilt was not mentioned by the participants in the interviews performed by Bührle & Kimmerle (2021).\nSadness. Sadness was measured by one cross-sectional study, which found a significant positive correlation with public-sphere action likelihood, r = .59 (Hornsey & Fielding, 2016).\n\n\n2.2.2.5 Social norms and networks\nSocial norms are typically split into injunctive norms and descriptive norms. In this literature, injunctive norms are typically measured as the extent to which ‘important others’ would support or encourage the participant to engage in a particular activity, while descriptive norms are typically measured as the extent to which important others would themselves engage in a particular activity (or already do). Some articles did not differentiate between the two and only presented results for a collapsed measure. Where possible, however, I report on the associations for norm category separately.\nInjunctive Norms. Three cross-sectional studies explicitly measured prescriptive norms, with mixed results. Two found significant positive correlations6 with collective engagement (Goldberg et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2019), and one did not (Gulliver et al., 2023). I can think of two salient explanations for these differing results. First, the studies with significant effects measured more passive forms of engagement—policy support (no r value available) and hypothetical behavioral willingness (r = .54)—while the study finding a non-significant effect measured actual past behaviors. A second possibility, however, is that the first two studies sampled the general public, where norms may exert more influence on future engagement, whereas Gulliver et al. (2023) measured already-active citizens. Engaged participants probably consider their participation to be valuable already, so social norms may not have additional predictive power in discriminating between differing levels of behavior among this group.\nDescriptive Norms. Two papers also measured descriptive norms, separately from injunctive norms. Xie et al. (2019) found a correlation of r = .41 between descriptive norms and willingness to engage in collective climate action. Goldberg et al. (2021) did not present the raw correlation coefficients but also found a significant, positive relationship between descriptive norms and climate policy support.\nMixed Injunctive/Descriptive Norms. Two papers examined prescriptive and descriptive norms as a composite measure. Both Rees & Bamberg (2014) and Bamberg et al. (2015) found significant positive relationships with collective behavioral intentions (rs = .65 and .57, respectively).\nSocial Networks. Finally, the role of social and informational networks merits a brief mention here. Bührle & Kimmerle (2021) found that invitation to participate by friends or roommates played a central role in the beginning of activism. This parallels work outside of the climate domain by Snow et al. (1980), who found that the majority of group recruitment happens through one’s social network, by friends and family.\n\n\n2.2.2.6 Climate beliefs\nBelief in climate change is typically measured in a few different ways, which we have organized in the following way: Climate change is real refers to belief in global warming, irrespective of cause; Climate change is human-caused refers specifically to belief that global warming is anthropogenic; Climate impacts are beliefs that demonstrate understanding of the negative impacts of climate change; and Climate change response is the belief that one knows how to effectively respond to climate change (measured by one study).\nMeta-Analytic Findings. A meta-analysis by Hornsey and colleagues (2016) analyzed 25 polls & 171 academic studies across 56 nations. They found a significant, positive average effect of climate beliefs (broadly construed) on public-sphere behavioral intentions, r = .32, and public-sphere behavioral actions, r = .19. They also measured policy support, and despite a significant positive relationship, they found that the link between climate change beliefs and policy support got smaller the more specific and concrete the measure of policy support, and the more the policy implied personal cost on behalf of the respondent. All of the relationships found were stronger in American samples.\nClimate Change is Real. Two subsequent cross-sectional studies measured belief in climate change, finding significant relationships around r = .55 (one r not available, but reported a significant beta coefficient) (Hall et al., 2018; Goldberg et al., 2021).\nClimate Change is Human-Caused. Three subsequent cross-sectional studies specifically measured belief in anthropogenic climate change, again finding significant positive correlations, ranging from r = .15-.66 (Hall et al., 2018; Goldberg et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2019). The wide range may be due to country differences, as Hall et al. (2018) found a large effect size in the U.S. (r = .66), where this belief may be more diagnostic of ideology, while Xie et al. (2019) sampled Australians (r = .15), where climate science may be less polarized. Additionally, the meta-analysis conducted by Hornsey et al. (2016) noted that relationships between climate beliefs and all forms of behavioral engagement or policy support were stronger when measuring belief in human-caused climate change as opposed to climate change more generally.\nClimate Change Impacts. Xie et al., (2019) also measured beliefs about the impact of climate change, as well as a global evaluation of the extent to which climate change was bad. Unsurprisingly both measures were positively correlated with reported willingness to take action (r =.23 and .53, respectively).\nClimate Change Responses. Finally, Xie et al., (2019) noted that, in their sample, the relationship between behavioral willingness and either (a) belief about the existence of climate change and (b) its impacts, were smaller than knowledge about how to effectively respond to it (r = .38).\n\n\n2.2.2.7 Other Threads\nIf two or fewer papers reported on a particular theme in relation to collective behavior, I include mention of it below.\nPersonal Experience. Xie et al., (2019) found a significant, positive correlation between personal experiences of extreme weather and collective behavioral willingness, r = .26.\nValue Orientations. Xie et al., (2019) found significant, positive correlations between value orientations and collective behavioral willingness. Biospheric values were correlated at r =.43. Socio-altruistic values were correlated at r =.34. Egoistic values were unrelated.\nPerceived Injustice. Furlong & Vignoles (2021) reported a significant, positive correlation between perceived injustice and past actual behavior on behalf of the Extinction Rebellion, r = .28.\nMoral Conviction. Furlong & Vignoles (2021) reported a significant, positive correlation between moral conviction and past actual behavior on behalf of the Extinction Rebellion, r = .25. Van Zomeren et al. (2019) also found a significant, positive correlation with collective intention, r = .50.\nOrganizational Climate. Gulliver et al. (2023) found no correlation between organizational climate (such as clearly specified roles) and reported behaviors. However, in their open-ended responses, participants often cited organizational climate as a reason for taking on more activities.\nPleasantness of Engagement. Bamberg et al. (2015) found a correlation between the perceived pleasantness of engagement and hypothetical intention to participate, r =.47.\nPublic Figures. Sabherwal et al., (2021) found a significant, positive relationship between awareness of the public figure Greta Thurnburg and public-sphere behavioral intentions, r = .28. The relationship was reduced but still significant after controlling for overall climate supportiveness, and it was stronger among the political left.\nSense of Responsibility. In their qualitative analysis, Bührle & Kimmerle (2021) found that strong feelings of responsibility played an important role in participants’ initial involvement and also grew over time."

    "section": "2.3 Part III: What is Still Unknown",
    "text": "2.3 Part III: What is Still Unknown\n\n2.3.1 Chapter Limitations\nThis chapter will conclude with an overview of salient questions that are still unknown, based on our review of the literature. However, before that, it is worth noting that this chapter itself is limited in many ways, mostly regarding scope.\nWe purposefully constrained the scope of the chapter to only include research on public-sphere variables related to climate change, as opposed to any other form of collective movement. This excluded much work that focused on environmental activism more broadly, with the rationale that climate change is a unique threat requiring distinct actions within the broader environmental movement. This also excluded many influential papers relevant to the overarching topic of collective action, pertaining to any movement. Yet there is much to learn from work about other kinds of activism, some of which is sourced from other disciplines. It would be worth doing a broader review to see what has been demonstrated in other domains that would be applicable here.\nEven within the discipline of psychology, there are fundamental phenomena that may be relevant to the climate problem. Foundational findings on cooperation, group dynamics, social learning, choice architecture, and behavioral change more generally might be applied to the climate crisis in powerful ways, which we have not reviewed here.\nFinally, the summaries in this chapter should be taken with the caveat that we do not consider this an exhaustive review of the literature. Although we sought to be as comprehensive as possible, we did not follow meta-analytic standards (e.g., PRISMA) for review, and some studies may have been missed.\n\n\n2.3.2 Gaps in the Scientific Understanding\n\n2.3.2.1 Behavior Change\nWith the exception of one meta-analysis that included experimental effects of environmental identity, none of the articles I reviewed provide real information about behavior change. Because the vast number of studies in this literature are cross-sectional, they do not capture change itself, but only relationships between other constructs and someone’s self-reported propensity to engage in action. Framed that way, the findings in this chapter are not particularly surprising or enlightening – it seems natural that these constructs covary together in some fashion. However, these associations don’t necessarily indicate which variables would boost collective climate action, if manipulated. Understanding the directional, causal structure is essential, because only then will we know which levers to pull. This is what is both needed and lacking. Given finite resources to galvanize more people who are not currently engaged, it would be useful to know where, exactly, placing our efforts would have an impact.\nThus, one open question is: which, if any, of these findings work experimentally? Alternatively, scientists could also leverage prospective longitudinal designs to capture shifts in people’s engagement and identify important antecedents.\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Intention-Behavior Gap\nAnyone who has ever resolved in January to create a daily gym habit will know that intentions are a poor substitute for actual behavior. This is evident in our review of the literature, too. For example, data from Furlong & Vignoles (2021) show that among currently active Extinction Rebellion members, the mean level of actual behavior was slightly below the scale midpoint, while the mean level of participation intention is well above the midpoint—a large discrepancy. Moreover, models that predict actual behavior tend to only explain about a third of the variance, while models predicting intentions often explain more than two-thirds (e.g., Gullivan et al. 2023 vs. Bamberg et al., 2015). Therefore, basing our research on intentions could result in an inflated sense of how comprehensively we can understand and predict these dynamics.\nSo, adding to the previous open question: which of the associations presented in this chapter would help boost actual behavior, as opposed to mere intentions?\n\n\n2.3.2.3 Boosting Motivation or Dismantling Obstacles?\nRelated to the intention-behavior gap, little research in this literature addressed behavioral obstacles in addition to sources of motivation. YSomeone might be highly motivated—whether because of their conviction, negative affect, social norms, environmental identity, or any other channel elucidated here—and still not engage in climate action because of specific barriers in their way. In Gulliver et al. (2023), when allowed to share open-ended responses about reasons for engagement, participants brought up different things when asked why people did engage versus why they didn’t. People reported engaging because of things like passion, self-efficacy, and a good organizational climate. People reported not engaging because of perceived behavioral control: a lack of ability to engage due to family, work, or money, for example.\nThe open question is: what else might be getting in the way of individuals engaging in collective action, especially among people who would otherwise take part? Psychologically, what might we be missing as hidden obstacles? Is there inertia that stems from lack of awareness about where/how to engage? Are there misperceptions about the amount of time required to do so? What tend to be the competing goals that win-out for people’s time? These are just some of the ideas that might be prompted by considering obstacles, as opposed to only motivation.\n\n\n2.3.2.4 Sample Heterogeneity\nSample heterogeneity and differential motives have been unexamined as an explanatory factor of behavior\nOne specific open question is: are the mechanisms of action different for people who are already involved in some climate activism, versus those who are uninvolved? For example, it might be the case that things like climate beliefs, fear, or social norms propel individuals to seek out engagement in the first place, but once they are involved, the well of motivation springs from things like personal or collective efficacy, perceived behavioral control, or identification with the group. Some studies recruit naive samples, while others recruit already engaged citizens, but none of this work has attempted to assess whether there are differential motives.\nAdditionally, many of the findings presented here are drawn from different countries, which is fantastic from a representation standpoint, but also potentially relevant for practitioners seeking to apply the findings in other countries. Nations vary in both their political environments and affordances for engagement. While the U.S. has one of the largest carbon burdens, it is also one of the most environmentally politicized. Thus, political ideology might be a more important moderator in U.S. samples, while there might be other unexamined variables that are particularly relevant to the political processes in other countries. This has, to our knowledge, not been directly addressed.\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Resources for future research\n\n2.3.3.1 List of existing validated scales\nActivism Orientation Scale (Corning & Myers, 2002)\n\n35-item scale with two subscales: conventional activism and high-risk activism\nItems are geared toward political activism in general but could easily be tailored for climate activism specifically\nCorrelates highly with another scale of environmental activism\nNot widely used since its development\n\nEnvironmental Activism Scale (Seguin et al., 1998)\n\n6-item scale that asks respondents to indicate the extent of their current engagement in various environment-related activities\nMore widely used, but items are also potentially out-of-date\n\nClimate Change Concern (Chryst et al., 2018)\n\n4-item scale used to subdivide samples into 6 levels of climate concern & engagement\nMost widely used"

    "section": "3.1 PART I: A Brief Introduction to Social Identity",
    "text": "3.1 PART I: A Brief Introduction to Social Identity\nSocial identity plays a pivotal role in shaping the lives of individuals. Even before birth, our communities contribute to the formation of our identities, which continue to influence our decisions and actions throughout our lives, including those related to climate issues. In the 1970s, Tajfel and Turner defined social identity theory as \"the part of an individual's self-concept that is derived from their membership in various social groups\" (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Patricia Hills Collins further developed this theory by introducing intersectionality, a critical social theory that examines how individuals' identities interact and integrate to form a holistic sense of self (Hill Collins, 2019). Due to the intertwined nature of identity, it is challenging to isolate the impact of one element of a person's social identity on their behavior. However, within the literature on climate psychology, certain patterns emerge that shed light on how specific group affiliations can result in a wide range of climate-related behaviors.\nWhen discussing social identity, it is important to recognize that identities are not uniformly developed. Social identity theory distinguishes between ascribed identities and avowed identities. Ascribed identities are \"aspects determined at birth over which people had little control\" (Jackson & Hogg, 2010), while avowed identities are those we claim for ourselves (Communication in the Real World, 2016). Examples of ascribed identities include race, assigned sex at birth, ethnicity, social class, and nationality, while avowed identities encompass gender, political affiliation, occupation, and religious beliefs. It is crucial to note that the boundaries between these categories are fluid and have evolved throughout history. For instance, gender, until recently, was predominantly seen as an ascribed identity assigned based on an individual's biological sex at birth.\nGiven the complexity of simultaneously holding multiple identities, the majority of our identities tend to feel insignificant most of the time. Social psychologists use the term \"salience\" to describe the activation of a particular identity. The salience of an identity is determined by factors such as its relevance to the situation and the individual's commitment or embeddedness in that identity (Stets & Burke, 231). In other words, for an identity to influence behavior, it must be pertinent to both the person and the specific circumstances. This notion is pertinent to our work as behavior change requires a certain degree of identity salience in order to occur.\nIn a classic study by Levine et al. Manchester United soccer fans were asked about their team affiliation and love of soccer before being asked to go to another part of the building to complete part two of the study. On their way to the second location they passed a confederate jogger who had supposedly fallen and twisted their ankle. The researchers measured how many participants stopped to help the “injured runner” based on the shirt the confederate was wearing. When they were wearing a Manchester United jersey 92% of participants stopped to help, when they were wearing jersey from Liverpool (the rival team) 30% of participants stopped to help, and when they were wearing a blank t-shirt 33% of participants stopped to help. The increased salience of the Manchester United identity highly impacted their willingness to help a fellow fan (Levine et al., 2005). When it comes to the climate crisis identity salience is a complex challenge, the correct identity must be salient at the correct moment in order to inspire action.\nFinally, it is crucial to acknowledge that identities are not static throughout a lifespan. Generally, avowed identities are more resistant to change than ascribed identities, as changes in avowed identities often require external influences. However, considering the fluidity of social norms and the arbitrary boundaries of human categorization, no aspect of identity remains fixed.. Baumeister and Muraven (1996) suggest that adaptation to the sociocultural context is the primary driver of adult identity change. This theory holds significant relevance for climate action, given that the sociocultural context will inevitably undergo transformation due to the changing environmental landscape. As the planet continues to warm, the relevance of the climate crisis will exponentially increase.\nThe subsequent sections will delve into the influence of specific social identities on climate action and explore how social identity can be harnessed to promote positive climate action."

    "section": "3.2 PART II: How does social identity impact climate action?",
    "text": "3.2 PART II: How does social identity impact climate action?\nAt the outset it is worth noting and conceding that identities impacts on behavior operate broadly, although there is growing consensus that identity is an important predictor of both climate attitudes and behaviors (Vesely, 2021). However, these two do need to be treated separately. As Vesley et al. observe, identity may be relevant to the study of climate change attitudes in two different ways. Identity may influence the extent to which specific behaviors are seen favorably or unfavorably but this might not impact behavior, if associated costs of that behavior are too high. On the other hand, identity can influence behavior if the behaviors are interpreted to be self-expressive of individuals' identities (2021, 2). Both observations have important implications for the study of the psychology of climate change. In the first instance, understanding how to shift perceptions of pro-climate behaviors could have significant political utility, and pro-climate self-expressions could be “crucial when thinking about large-scale climate change mitigation efforts” (Vesley, 2021, 2).\nBefore diving into the sorts of identities that might be particularly relevant for conversations around climate change advocacy, we examine the pathways through which identity might either impact, (i) an individual's actual beliefs around climate change, and (ii) what sorts of actions an individual might be influenced to take or avoid, as a result of identity influenced factors.\nFirst, let us consider the relationship between cognition and belief formation, and identity. There are a number of pathways through which identity might impact cognition. The following section will draw from Kahan et. al and discuss three pathways that we find to be particularly relevant to our subject. The first, is the idea of identity-protective cognition, the second are culturally-informed theories of risk, and the third is social domination theory.\n\n3.2.1 Pathways for Identity Impacts on Cognition\nIdentity-protective cognition. Identity-protective cognition refers to the tendency of culturally diverse individuals to selectively credit and dismiss evidence in patterns that reflect the beliefs that predominate in their group. According to Dan Kahan, “The basic premise of identity protective cognition is that culture is prior to fact in the apprehension of societal risks” (Kahan, 2017, p.2). It is particularly worth noting that these impacts inform not just heuristic thinking but actually (often subconsciously) also inform systematic reasoning; consciously or not, there is credence given to a commonly held belief within one’s in-group (Kahan et. al, 2007, p. 470). Wischnewski and Kramer read identity-protection theory and social identity theory together, to suggest that identity-congruent information becomes “identity affirming” (2021, 2) when it affirms particular social identities - specifically, political identity.\nCultural theory of risk. Initially proposed by Mary Douglas posits that risk is culturally determined. Douglas offers a grid / group typology that categorizes various individuals’ world views scaled from relatively hierarchical-egalitarianism on one axis, and individualistic-communitarianism on the other (Kahan et. al). According to Douglas, individuals with stronger egalitarian and communitarian perspectives are more likely to be attuned to social environmental and technological risks (Kahan et. al, p. 469). A number of key issues are insufficiently explained by this theory. The first would be: the causal mechanisms that would explain why some individuals tend towards hierarchical or conversely egalitarian world views, and similarly, towards individualistic versus communitarianism ones (find citations in the literature that broad cultural positioning is insufficient). The second, and crucially for our purposes, it is not clear that particular orientations would be predictive of actually taking risk-adaptive behavior, so as a theory around climate action, further research is needed. Additionally, it is worth noting that in their meta-analysis, Vesely et al. note that individualist-collectivist orientation did not have s significant mediating effect on climate attitudes or behaviors, but concede that this might be the result of place-based biases (most studies included were in so-called “WEIRD” countries) (Vesely et. al., 2021).\nSocial domination orientation. Sometimes stated as the “extent to which one desires that one's in-group dominate and be superior to out-groups” (Pratto et al., 1994, p. 726), it can more generally be defined as a preference for the continuation of group-based hierarchies in line with the status quo - even if one’s group is not the dominant group (Bergh et al., 2019, p. 580).\n\n\n3.2.2 Discussion: moving from pathways to feelings and actions\nAlthough significant research exists to explain these pathways, there are a number of questions that remain unanswered with regard to climate relevant identities. The first is whether these cognitive processes sufficiently explain climate change attitudes, the second is whether they explain if they can support explanations for whether attitudes drive action - that is to say, do they sufficiently explain climate behaviors, and finally, whether these processes are salient across forms of identity and how that overlaps with the sorts of identities that are relevant for predicting climate attitudes and behavior.\n\n3.2.2.1 I. Identity and pro-climate attitudes\nTo start, let us consider the existing evidence that these cognitive processes do in fact, impact climate attitudes. In their meta-analysis, Vesely et al. find “robust positive associations” (2021, 3) between all identities they consider (place identity, connectedness to nature, environmental self-identity and social identity) and climate intentions or in our parlance, attitudes. Across 143 studies, they find the most robust relationship between environmental self-identity and climate attitude, noting that this particular identity is 0.62 correlated with pro-climate attitudes (i.e. intentions to act). They find the weakest relationship between pro-climate attitudes and social identity (r = 0.33) and place identity (r = 0.18). A major limitation of their coding mechanism is that they do not scale the degree or strength of these identities that’s required to produce strong positive correlations. It is worth noting that Vesely et al. conduct a bivariate zero-correlation analysis on effect size therefore results are likely overestimated, and the true correlations may be less robust than reported in this study.\nVesley et al. offer only a superficial explanation of the pathway through which these identities might impact climate attitudes but this point is worth dwelling on. These authors offer two hypotheses for how identities impact climate attitudes. The first, as has been discussed, is around self-conception and/or self-expression. The second, is the extent to which an individual views climate as a particularly salient issue for their social identity. Understanding these pathways is important. To the extent that enhancing the salience of pro-climate self-conception or pro-climate social group identification is possible, this observation offers a way to potentially trigger greater pro-climate attitudes. Understanding the types of identities that might be relevant can also help manage policy and political interventions, by carefully framing climate messages around particular pro-climate identities e.g. local-level habitat protection might appeal to an environmentalist identity, or to a place-based identity where an individual might be concerned with the long term protection of their home. However, as Vesely et al. note, these interventions must be carefully managed as they also risk compromising individual emotional wellbeing (e.g. through triggering extreme anger or reactivity) (2021, 5).\n\n\n3.2.2.2 II. Identity and pro-climate behaviors\nOn the surface, Vesley et al.’s meta-analysis seems to reveal similar results across attitudes and behaviors. As discussed above, they find in a review of 163 studies, that environmental self-identity is once more positively correlated with pro-climate behavior (r = 0.56), and other identities are positively but more weakly correlated. Interestingly, they do find that environmental self-identity is more strongly correlated with pro-climate intentions (attitudes) than it is with pro-climate behaviors, but the reverse relationship is true for the other identities tested (place identity, social identity, and level of “connectedness to nature\").\nIt is worth starting with the concession that some of this result might be spurious. Although Vesley et al. control for some important cross-paper differences including effect size, categories for independent and dependent variables, and publication bias, at the end of the day, they are constructing a synthetic scale of comparison (each underlying paper had vastly different methodologies) and it is difficult to call this an apples-to-apples comparison.\nThat being said, what might explain this intention-behavior gap, that’s at least suggested, and does it offer any insight on how social identity affects climate behavior? The literature is not clear on this but offers a number of useful threads. In their analyses, Vesely et al. suggest that at least part of the distance between intention and action, is the perception of the extent to which social norms around a particular identity, require individuals to act in pro-climate ways (2021). In this view, one can imagine that if there’s a high degree of friction to action, and pro-climate intentions and attitudes satisfy social membership, there is likely to be inertia around climate action. At the individual level, they also suggest that for some identities, self-expression and action are more tightly connected e.g. if I believe public transportation is an important part of the social fabric, then part of my self-identity will involve taking public transportation. However, others offer alternative explanations that might be worth exploring.\nThere are numerous non-experimental studies exploring the potential mechanisms for belief-action gaps, which tend to cover everything from insufficient information, to cognitive overload, to moral disengagement or distancing (Peeters et al., 2019). There is less empirical work around this question, and it merits further study. However, one interesting finding to consider comes from the work of Salomon, Preston, and Tannenbaum who find: (i) perceptions of climate change efficacy robs individuals of a sense of agency around climate change action, (ii) the resulting sense of helplessness leads individuals to “demoralize” climate action and no longer attach normative value to climate action, and (iii) that this pattern holds true, regardless of starting climate change belief and it is perceptions of efficacy, not climate beliefs, that determine whether a person views the taking action as an individual imperative (Salomon et al., 2017). Further research is needed to understand both what accounts for the gap between climate belief and action, and the role of mediators such as perceived efficacy and moralization of climate action. However, if replicated, Salomon et. al’s findings offer an exciting advocacy avenue: if advocates can more clearly articulate the story of climate impacts flowing from individual action (everything from home efficiency improvements to political actions), perhaps this could have a generally stimulating impact on pro-climate behavior.\n\n\n3.2.2.3 III. Which identities?\nFinally, it is worth discussing which sorts of identities might be relevant to the study of climate change action. Generally, there is little agreement on what identities are most salient “in predicting climate-related intentions and actual behavior” (Vesely at al, 2021, 2). Similar to Vesely et al., others have found that identities rooted in political positions, values, or ideologies, tend to be more predictive of climate behaviors, with other identities including the ascribed identities like age, race, gender, and even education-level, appear to be more indirect (Hornsey et al., 2016, Whitmarsh, 2011). The following section will explore how these identities mediate climate change belief and/or action."

    "text": "3.3 PART III: How Specific Identities Relate to Climate Change and Climate Action\n\n3.3.1 Identity as an Environmentalist\nThe term \"environmentalist\" refers to individuals who are concerned with or advocate for the protection of the environment (Oxford Languages). However, understanding the nuances between someone who is simply concerned and someone who actively advocates becomes crucial when examining this avowed identity in the context of the climate crisis. The label \"environmentalist\" is complex, as it can be perceived both as socially beneficial and harmful, depending on the situation. Due to the moral ambiguity associated with this identity, some people are reluctant to publicly display their affiliation with the environmental movement through collective action.\nLike all identities, environmentalism cannot be examined in isolation. The climate crisis has become highly politicized (a topic explored in-depth in section IIIc), leading many individuals to use public displays of environmentalism (or the lack thereof) to signal their political affiliation. Environmentalism is frequently used to display one's support for or adherence to certain moral, social, or political values, often in a performative or conspicuous manner, with the intention of gaining social approval. This phenomenon is called virtue signaling and plays an important role in demonstrating social identity. A study conducted by Brick, Sherman, and Kim in 2017 explored this phenomenon and found that \"environmentalist identity predicted pro-environmental behavior more strongly for high-visibility behaviors, controlling for individual-level confounds (attitudes, political identity) and behavior-level factors (difficulty, effectiveness)\" (Brick et al., 226). This influence of social identity on in-group norms and environmental action emphasizes the importance of considering visibility when addressing the climate crisis. While visible actions may engage certain demographics, they may also alienate others, highlighting the need for inclusive approaches to motivate broad and collective climate action.\nIn a 2014 study by Kashima, Paladino, and Margetts, researchers aimed to unravel the complexities of this social identity by distinguishing between two key elements: environmentalist identity and environmental striving. Environmentalist identity refers to being an environmentally friendly person according to cultural norms, while environmental striving encompasses personal motivations that go beyond these norms. The study found that individuals who identified as environmentalists were likely to engage in green shopping and green talk, whereas environmental strivers were more likely to make personal sacrifices such as driving less, which incurs higher personal costs. The authors acknowledged the limitations of their findings, as their study focused on only three behaviors, but they suggested that further examination of environmental striving's impact and cultivation is warranted. As they concluded, \"Whereas mundane environmentalism overlaps greatly with the mainstream of many industrialized (and even industrializing) societies, environmental activism situates itself outside the mainstream and attempts to change the society... If mundane environmentalism and environmental activism differentiate environmentalism along the political dimension of mainstream vs. activism, environmental striving is agnostic to the political dimension\" (Kashima et al., 73). This finding is an important consideration when analyzing the study below.\nIn a pre-registered study published in February 2023, researchers explored the distinction between environmental intent and impact among a representative sample of the British public. The study focused on participants' intentions to take collective climate action and their involvement with Extinction Rebellion (XR). XR defines itself as \"a decentralized, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency\" (What is XR?). The researchers hypothesized that individuals with high collective action intentions (defined as a willingness to perform behaviors such as donating to an environmental cause and posting on social media about their environmental views) and strong social identification with XR would exhibit greater engagement with XR. They predicted that this effect would be mediated by two factors: beliefs about XR's collective efficacy and norm perceptions of climate action.\nThe study's outcome variable was whether or not a participant joined XR's mailing list and the extent to which they were willing to answer additional questions to \"help XR.\" The majority of participants who agreed to additional questioning answered all five questions, leading the researchers to categorize this secondary measure of behavioral engagement with XR as a binary variable (Parkes et al., 9). The low barrier to entry for this outcome variable raises concerns about the study. The researchers were unable to provide strong support for their initial hypothesis or either of its mediators. However, they did find that the strongest predictor of social identification with XR (but not behavior) was whether or not participants held positive perceptions of XR members (Parkes et al., 17). Participants expressed various opinions about XR, and some criticized the movement for its extreme tactics, causing disruption and misery to ordinary people (Parkes et al., 21). While environmentalism can be used to virtue-signal, many environmentalists have a negative reputation, particularly when associated with extreme tactics employed by groups like XR.\nGiven the intricate network of virtues associated with an environmentalist identity, many individuals are hesitant to publicly proclaim their affiliation with this social group through collective action. Based on this review of the research, to encourage higher rates of climate action, organizations should encourage higher rates of climate action by adopting a dual strategy which promotes meaningful and private environmental behaviors (such as voting) while dissociating environmentalism from the radical activism associated with high-SES groups such as XR. Instead, it should focus on engaging environmental strivers who are motivated by actions that demonstrate their concern for the climate without necessitating the adoption of an activist identity.\n\n\n3.3.2 Political Identity\nPolitical polarization is far and away the most highly investigated topic when it comes to group identity and the climate crisis. The climate crisis has become highly politicized within developed countries, with the left perceiving it as an urgent matter demanding unwavering attention, while the right tends to downplay or even deny climate change. However, this stark division was not always so apparent. In the scholarly literature, climate change initially emerged as a scientific issue around 1970, remaining separate from political affiliations for the following two decades. It was only in the mid-1990s that climate change became a polarizing topic. Over the past 30 years, polarization regarding climate change has been rapidly increasing (see Chinn et al. for an in-depth discussion of this topic). Overcoming these entrenched political divides is crucial if we hope to address the climate crisis effectively.\nResearch on politics and climate primarily falls into two categories: partisan identity and political affiliation. Partisan identity refers to the group-level process of aligning politically with other members of one's community, while political ideology indicates an individual's position on the political spectrum, irrespective of their group identity. A 2017 meta-analysis investigated how the interaction between these factors shapes an individual's climate opinions. The analysis concluded that “the strengthening relationship between political affiliation and environmental concern is due primarily to partisan sorting, rather than to issue polarization on environmental issues” (Cruz, 2017). This finding is encouraging for the environmental movement since it suggests that changing the stance of a political party may be sufficient over changing the minds of individuals. If a small number of influential conservative voices within the Republican party were to express meaningful concern about the climate crisis, it could potentially shift the tide and lead to the passage of important policies.\nRegrettably, until recently, much of the literature on political polarization and climate change has focused on individual-level processes. Nonetheless, several noteworthy findings from this research deserve examination, particularly those related to the salience of partisan identities and downplaying their significance. As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, saliency plays a critical role in social identity. If an identity is not salient to us, it is unlikely to significantly impact our decisions or actions at a given moment. An Australian paper published in 2014 demonstrated the meaningful impacts of saliency on climate belief and action, “perceived human contribution to climate change was significantly lower for people who identified with the right-wing of politics and whose political identity was made salient (64.4%) than those people who identified with the right-wing of politics but whose political identity was not made salient (40.5%) (F(1,102) = 13.48, p &lt; .001)” (Unsworth & Fielding, 2014). It is striking to note that a mere difference in saliency resulted in a more than 20% difference in beliefs. Given the extreme level of polarization, this 20% can meaningfully influence policy. Additionally, if 20% of an ingroup shifts their opinion, it may serve as a catalyst for the remainder of the group to follow suit. With this in mind, the research turns to another crucial question: how can we de-emphasize political identities and uplift other aspects of an individual's identity?\nSeveral studies have attempted to address this question. A 2020 study found that among Republican parents, receiving a message about the impact of climate change on future generations increased their climate change concern and intended pro-climate political behaviors. However, this framing effect disappeared when a partisan identity was primed before the message (Diamond, 2020). Interestingly, the effect did not hold for Democratic parents; they needed to be primed with their Democratic identity prior to their parental identity to observe a meaningful shift in pro-climate behaviors. The researchers hypothesize two reasons for this backfiring effect. The first is that a focus on the future may make the crisis seem less urgent (i.e. it will impact my children’s children and not my children, therefore my direct level of concern is lower). The second reason is known as the “trump effect.” Given the timeline of the study the researchers were able to watch Democratic parents lose faith in the efficacy of their political actions pre- and post-Donald Trump’s election in 2016. The backfire effect may be due to “a reduction in perceived effectiveness of political action on climate change after the change in presidential administration in 2017” (Diamond, 1145). Unfortunately, there is no foolproof method to predict or prevent such backfiring, which is why individual interventions targeting identity salience should be approached cautiously.\nThe next consideration is what can and should be done to leverage group-level political affiliations. Based on a recently published review of the literature the most promising suggestions seem to be “correcting misperceptions of social norms, and…having trusted leaders—whether political elites, other elites, or experts— communicate about climate change” (Schulte et al., 2020). These approaches rely on combating something known as pluralistic ignorance within the Republican party concerning the climate crisis. Pluralistic ignorance is a situation in which a person thinks that their privately held beliefs are contrary to the majority’s beliefs, when in actuality the majority also holds the same beliefs. The majority is individually afraid to openly oppose a norm because it appears that everyone else agrees with it, so the widely unsupported norm continues. When it comes to Republican concern surrounding the climate crisis, the utilization of a few key political figures within the Republican party and a leveraging of salient non-political identities (such as parenthood) have the potential to significantly alter the party's beliefs on the subject.\nAlthough the polarization of the climate crisis has been portrayed as a negative occurrence thus far, the prioritization of group identity over personal beliefs may ultimately facilitate rapid change. By highlighting non-political identities relevant to the climate crisis, challenging social norms rooted in misconceptions about the reality of global warming, and leveraging the voices of influential political leaders within the Republican party, we have the potential to significantly reduce climate change polarization. The critical question that needs to be addressed moving forward is how to incentivize the aforementioned steps.\n\n\n3.3.3 Racial and Cultural Identity\n\n3.3.3.1 Overview – unpacking the role of race, and culture in climate change research\nIn closing, we discuss existing research between ascribed, stable social identities and climate change. For the purposes of this discussion, we focus primarily on racial and cultural identity. In part because these demographic dimensions tend to be generally underrepresented in the literature on climate change (Salil Benegal et al., 2022), with a lot of the empirical work reviewed in this volume, instead focusing on age, educational status, socio-economic status, and gender.\nAs discussed in the preceding section of this chapter, researchers have generally found that demographic identities are less likely to be directly predictive of climate change attitudes. However, it is worth exploring the research that does exist liking demographic identities to climate change attitudes for at least three reasons. The first, is that demographic identities are likely to be highly correlated with, if not causally influence characteristics like political identity (84% of Black voters and 63% of Latino voters are registered Democrats (Pew Research Center, 2018)), or identity as an environmentalist (e.g. through strong place-based ties). The second, is that it is reasonable to believe that demographic identities, and in particular, race and culture, would have impact different characteristics identified in earlier chapters as being correlated with climate change behavior or belief (e.g. levels of social trust, risk perception, social norms, perceived behavioral control, identification with nature). Finally, demographic factors may influence dynamics that determine climate change attitudes, that have not been extensively covered in this volume, such as subjective adaptive capacity (which refers to the ability of an individual, or a community, to adapt to the impacts of climate change) (Fresque-Baxter & Armitage, 2012).\nBefore reviewing available findings, it is worth noting that overall, the relationship between climate change beliefs and racial or cultural identities, generally merits significantly more study (Salil Benegal et al., 2022). Much of the empirical work in climate change, draws from survey pools that are not nationally representative and generally, have predominantly white recipient pools (Rode et. al, 2021). Secondly, much of the empirical work on climate change tends to focus on climate change beliefs but some scholars have found evidence that racial differences may be more pronounced with respect to attitudes towards climate change policy. With these general limitations in mind, it is important to read the highlighted findings below with reasonable skepticism, and perhaps consider the following discussion as offering a series of starting points for more comprehensive research on the relationship between racial and cultural identities, and climate change attitudes and beliefs.\n\n\n3.3.3.2 Key findings in literature on race, cultural identity, and climate change attitudes\nExisting research suggests that the climate change attitudes are less polarized among non-White groups. Schuldt et al.(2016) ran a OLS regression analysis on survey data from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel survey and found that conservative ideology was almost twice as predictive of climate change personal belief (bwhite = -.52, bnon-white = -0.28)1 likelihood of perceiving scientific consensus on the issue (interaction between political ideology and perception of consensus Whites: χ2 (1351) = 204.16, versus non-Whites: χ2 (661) = 44.97), and supporting government intervention for Whites than non-Whites. Perhaps most significantly for the purposes of our discussion, Schuldt et. al - building off prior work that observed non-White liberals are less likely to identify as environmentalists due to perceived barriers to entry and low levels of acceptance in environmental groups (Taylor 2007, 2014) - also found that non-White liberals were significantly less likely to identify as environmentalists (71.8% of White liberals, versus 53.8% of non-White liberals identified as environmentalists).2 Considering this, it is worth further study to understand how the attitude and behavioral effects associated with identity as an environmentalist, vary among non-Whtie groups. These findings were reinforced in a larger dataset, in a cross-sectional analysis of US national polling data between 2008 - 2019 (Ballew et. al, 2021). Ballew et. al. find that in general, people of color “have significantly greater levels of acceptance that global warming is happening, and higher global warming risk perceptions than Whites” (Ballew et. al, 2021, 3). It is worth noting that Ballew et al. did find that issue polarization on climate change increased over time across all groups, in the decade the survey was repeated, although polarization effects remained consistently weaker among people of color than Whites.\nIt is possible that non-White populations have higher rates of climate change belief and higher levels of risk perception surrounding climate change. This observation is drawn from Teyton and Abramson’s work, which studied climate change attitudes among Hurricane Katrina survivors. Teyton and Abramson (2021) found exposure to Hurricane Katrina and recent flooding events and hurricanes had positive associations with climate change beliefs (OR: 8, and OR: 5.2 respectively). However white individuals (across cohorts e.g. less educated vs more educated) had significant negative associations with climate change belief (OR: 0.2). It is worth noting that the odds’ ratios across outcomes do not represent large-sized effects. Nonetheless, Teyton and Abramson found that race was found to be the only significant variable among Katrina survivors that impacted climate change belief (also tested were income, age, gender, education, influence of news and science reports, influence of friends and family). The study concludes that findings reflect the fact that among this population (Katrina survivors), race was a strong predictor of level of exposure to damage, as well as ability to recover, explaining heightened risk. As the number of climate related natural disasters’ increases risk exposure and racial dynamics merit further study.\nAdditional studies suggest room compelling further research on the relationship between additional socio-demographic categories and climate attitudes. The studies reviewed so far in this section leave a lot on the table with respect to racial and cultural determinants of climate attitudes. First, they do not sufficiently explore why some of the determinants we’ve explored through this volume (e.g. identity as an environmentalist) differ between racial or cultural identity. Second, they narrowly focus on race in a binary construction (White versus non-White), and do not explore different group dynamics within non-White communities that might warrant study. And finally, they tend not to consider additional socio-demographic conditions that might impact climate attitudes. However, there is available work that hints at the productive possibilities that further exploring some of these questions might open up.\nFor instance, Pearson et. al, find that political ideology is not a robust predictor of climate attitudes among Latinos, but familism - a “relational value reflecting a strong attachment to family and prioritization of family over self” (2021, p. 11) - is. The study runs an OLS regression for both belief and policy support on Ipsos KnowledgePanel survey data, and finds that familism significantly predicted belief certainty (b = 0.49), policy support (b = 0.33) and perceived scientific consensus (b = 0.34) among Latinos. Interestingly, their model found that no other variables, including political ideology, was a significant predictor of climate attitudes for this sample. This study should be read with a degree of skepticism. Although Hispanic and Latino respondents were oversampled, the overall size of the sample was small (n = 202) and the only analytical tool deployed was OLS, so it is possible that the effect size is, in truth, likely far smaller than the headline finding suggests. That being said, this study hints at an interesting avenue for further research: it is possible that the relevant individual and behavioral predictors we’ve suggested, may potentially need to be nuanced by socio-demographic category.\nAnother interesting and more unique study in Australia, studied the impact of religious identity on climate belief. Morrison et al., (2015) find that overall, religious affiliation was a far weaker predictor of climate attitudes than other socio-demographic indicators like age, education level, or race. However, in an ordinal regression model that controlled for attitudes and other socio-demographics, being Buddhist had a significant but small effect on the level of climate change concern. It would not be prudent to draw too large a conclusion from this study but it does prompt a discussion around the potential relationship between religious adherence and values that might impact climate change attitudes that have been discussed throughout this volume."

    "section": "4.1 Context",
    "text": "4.1 Context\nThis chapter aims to provide an overview of the psychological concepts relevant to climate change and human behavior from the perspective of time. By understanding how individuals perceive and prioritize time in relation to climate change, we can develop effective strategies to reduce temporal gaps and foster the kinds of individual and collective pro-environmental mitigation behaviors that are urgently needed to limit catastrophic climate and ecological breakdown (IPCC, 2022). The broader psychological literature on time and human behavior is extensive (Roeckelein, 2000); it includes people’s temporal perceptions, awareness, construal, experience, decisions, gratifications, and intertemporal choices within the cognitive, affective, and behavioral structures humans use to make sense of time (Strathman & Joireman, 2005, p. 4). While this chapter narrows the scope of inquiry to the specific context of climate change, it is not intended as an exhaustive literature review, but rather as a starting point for the most relevant concepts—in the current absence of other such systematic material, other than Pahl et al.’s (2014) selective review—that the reader is invited to further explore on their own. Each section first introduces the relevant concept within the general psychological literature and then contextualizes it within the climate change-specific literature.\nClimate change, by its very nature, is a ‘wicked problem’ (Rittel & Webber, 1973), and especially a temporal ‘wicked problem’ for a species—Homo sapiens—whose average lifespan is around 73.4 years (WHO, 2019). The time scales of its negative effects are delayed by the phenomenon’s “extension into the future” (Pahl et al., 2014, p. 376): i.e., the time between carbon dioxide emission and its full warming effect may be decades or even centuries (Zickfeld & Herrington, 2015). Even within a single human lifespan, there are significant evolutionary mechanisms that constrain our understanding and interaction with these long-term temporal dynamics, confronting our “ancient brain [that] has not evolved much in thousands of years” (Gifford, 2011, p. 291) with unprecedented, planetary-level environmental deterioration. Even modern societal time horizons, such as four or five year election cycles, clash with the nature of climate change (Pahl et al., 2014). As such, with these physical and societal dynamics in mind, we now turn to the range of psychological concepts that aim to capture these uniquely human temporal attributes in the context of climate change behavior."

    "section": "4.2 Temporal perspective and temporal orientation",
    "text": "4.2 Temporal perspective and temporal orientation\nThe psychological concepts of temporal perspective and temporal orientation are closely related, and together they address individuals’ attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and behaviors concerning time. More specifically, they help us understand how individuals (1) relate to time and (2) make decisions in the context of their relation to time. However, because these two concepts focus on slightly different aspects of individuals’ relationship with time, they also have different meanings and applications. In the context of this chapter, they capture different temporal influences on an individual’s climate change behavior, and it is thus important to explore this nuance for the potentially unique insights each concept may offer.\nTemporal perspective or time perspective is understood as “the composite cognitive structures that characterize the way an individual projects, collects, accesses, values, and organizes events that reside in distinct temporal loci” (Lasane & O’Donnell, 2005, p. 12). Put more simply, these temporal loci refer to the past, present, and future, and using this temporal categorization helps us make sense of the world by giving order and coherence to events (Boyd & Zimbardo, 2005, p. 88). Numerous studies confirm these three temporal loci are indeed distinct (Joireman et al., 2008; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999): we live in the present, but have stored and recalled past events, and can form plans and hopes for the future. Indeed, “between the abstract, psychological constructions of prior past and anticipated future events lies the concrete, empirically centered representation of the present action moment” (Boyd & Zimbardo, 2005, p. 88). While not expanded upon further in this chapter due to length, it is important to mention that within this framework, past, present, and future each contain the distinct dimensions of extension, density, valence, accessibility, content, and structural organization (Jones, 1993). The most widely used validated measurement tool is the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI), developed to measure individual variation and biases in time perspective, meaning an individual’s dominant perspective bias towards either the past, present, or future (Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). Its five subscales consist of (1) Past-Negative, (2) Present-Hedonistic, (3) Future, (4) Past-Positive, and (5) Present-Fatalistic. A meta-analysis of 19 studies, representing over 6,000 participants, found associations between these five temporal perspectives and pro-environmental behaviors, and especially so for those higher in the third future time perspective, thus implicating this temporal perspective dimension as important in climate change behavioral outcomes (Milfont et al., 2012).\nRelatedly, Kooji et al. (2018) have advanced the concept of Future Time Perspective (FTP), from previous disparate and cross-disciplinary conceptualizations to a common understanding of FTP that “focuses on an individual’s tendency to anticipate and structure one’s future and […] capture how an individual tends to experience situations and respond to them affectively and behaviorally”, with major consequences on a wide array of life domains, including health and risk behavior (p. 867). Humans, on average, struggle to envision the future further than 10-20 years (Tonn et al., 2006), and as such, mapping the determinant characteristics of those high on FTP, and even further, studying how to increase individuals’ FTP, is crucial.\nTemporal orientation or time orientation can be understood as a cognitive bias, or if chronically elicited, an individual difference variable, toward being personally more past, present, or future oriented. It is “characteristic and predictive of how the individual will respond across a host of daily life choice situations” and “may include either habitual over- or underuse of one or more of these temporal frames” (Boyd & Zimbardo, 2005, p. 88-89). The most widely used measurement tool for mapping stable individual differences in temporal orientation, meaning the different importance people attach to the immediate vs. delayed consequences of their actions, is the Considerations of Future Consequences (CFC) scale (Strathman et al., 1994). The authors conceptualize this as “an intrapersonal struggle […] than an interpersonal struggle between benefit to self and others (i.e. social value orientation)” (Joireman et al., 2001, p. 137). Among the earliest evidence, Joireman and colleagues (2001) found people that are high in CFCs have stronger pro-environmental intentions, behaviors, and beliefs. In a more recent study, using a sample size of n=798 and with 81% power to detect a “small” regression effect, Geiger et al. (2021) found temporal orientation, and especially future orientation, to moderate the relationship between climate engagement and age, with higher CFCs indeed being more engaged with climate change."

    "title": "4  The psychology of time, climate change, and human behavior",
    "section": "4.3 The temporal dimension of psychological distance",
    "text": "4.3 The temporal dimension of psychological distance\nThe three most discussed psychological aspects of time are temporal perception, temporal orientation, and temporal construal (Strathman & Joireman, 2005, p. 5)—as such, following an overview of the previous two, we now turn to construal level theory (CLT) and the concept of psychological distance (PD) that is built upon it. CLT posits that we form “abstract mental construals of distal objects” (Trope & Liberman, 2010, p. 440), meaning that we make mental constructions of the past and present that are distinct from the present and its direct, immediate experiences. These mental constructions, representing the past and/or present, give rise to psychologically distant objects that translate into the subjective experience of PD (Trope & Liberman, 2010). In essence, PD encapsulates the idea that we respond differently when an object, event, or issue is perceived as close or far away (Maiella et al., 2020). It is conceptualized alongside the four dimensions of temporal distance (present versus future), spatial distance (near versus far), social distance (close others versus distant others), and hypothetical distance (real versus imaginary scenarios) (Trope & Liberman, 2010). While the focus here is on temporal distance for obvious reasons, it is worth noting that the dimensions of PD are often interrelated and mentally associated (Trope & Liberman, 2010), and this is especially the case for time and space. Indeed, spatial metaphors are often used to refer to time in everyday language and reasoning (Boroditsky, 2007), but even beyond that, time and space are both spacetime dimensions in physics theories (Lasane & O’Donnell, 2005, p. 12).\nNonetheless, the temporal dimension of PD plays a crucial role in the context of climate change. Study participants who noted not seeing climate change effects said they saw little reason to react but could still better visualize its effects when they were made personally relevant (Nicholson-Cole, 2005). While the world, including more geographically fortunate regions to-date, is undoubtedly warming, and increasingly and more visibly so in the most recent years, many people still either perceive climate change as a distant or future problem, or perceive it as being more severe in the future (Leiserowitz, 2005). These, at the very least, contribute to a temporal psychological disconnect between present actions and long-term climate consequences. Furthermore, this perception of temporal distance can result in reduced engagement and motivation to take immediate action.\nWhile research to date has found a relation between PD and pro-environmental behaviors in the context of climate change, findings are not exactly consistent. A systematic review of 19 studies shows some people do not perform climate change mitigation behaviors despite perceiving climate change as real and psychologically proximal, while others do despite their PD to climate change, indicating that other psychological factors may also be at play (Maiella et al., 2020). Among the reviewed studies, 12 investigated temporal distance alongside other PD dimensions, with two focusing exclusively on the temporal dimension. Both used undergraduate student sample populations; the first examined temporal message framing in environmental advertising and its effect on pro-environmental behavioral intentions (Kim & Ahn, 2019), while the second more directly explored the relationship between temporal distance, actual behavior, and social norms (Soliman et al., 2018). The former found lower temporal distance associated with higher pro-environmental behavioral intention, but the latter, which also measured actual behavior and not just intent, only found this effect in combination with social norms (i.e., pro-environmental behavior as normative).\nThe most recent 30-study systematic review not only confirms these mixed findings, but argues that the PD of climate change, especially in terms of its effect on behavior, is categorically overestimated (van Valkengoed et al., 2023). One of the pillars the authors build this overall argument upon, based on 12 different opinion polls, is the premise that the temporal distance of climate change itself is hyperbolized. They posit that a “consistent majority of respondents indicated that they believed that the consequences of climate change are already occurring now or will occur within the next few years” (van Valkengoed et al., 2023, p. 363). However, a closer examination of this language reveals a potential conflation of present and future despite these being distinct theoretical temporal constructs, and indeed, within the ZTPI, “an individual’s score on one construct is unrelated to his or her score on the other construct” (Boyd & Zimbardo, 2005, p. 94). Nonetheless, van Valkengoed and colleagues’ (2023) work demonstrates that most studies (25 out of 30) failed to show that decreased PD to climate increases pro-environmental behaviors, although it could not comment on specific PD dimensions due to most experiments manipulating numerous dimensions simultaneously. They recommend that future research build on their finding that climate change is perceived as happening here and now by most people (Ibid., 2023). However, an important note here is the earlier observation by Pahl (2010) that a simple question-framing difference about behavior—i.e., asking study participants how instead of why to reduce plastic bag usage led them to estimate reducing this behavior quicker—and as such, it is suggested that this ‘how effect’ in psychological construals be further disentangled in future studies and systematic reviews.\nStrategies to reduce the temporal distance of climate change include (1) the general umbrella approach of temporally framing it as more proximal, as well as (2) increased future self-continuity approaches. This latter posits that “when the future self shares similarities with the present self, when it is viewed in vivid and realistic terms, […] people are more willing to make choices today that may benefit them at some point in the years to come.” (Hershfield, 2011). Further, in a series of studies to reduce the environmental attitude-behavior gap, the saliency of the distant-future perspective mattered more when study participants conceptualized their country’s environmental situation a decade later (Rabinovich et al., 2010). Overall, much remains to be understood about the PD concept in relation to climate change, and specifically its temporal dimension."

    "text": "4.4 Temporal discounting, preference, and intertemporal choice\nFinally, the psychological concept of temporal preference or time preference, and the behavioral economics concept of temporal discounting or time discounting, is reviewed. While some may posit that the latter is essentially a manifestation of the former, Frederick et al. (2002) provide the following nuanced definitions: “We use the term time discounting broadly to encompass any reason for caring less about a future consequence, including factors that diminish the expected utility generated by a future consequence, such as uncertainty or changing tastes. We use the term time preference to refer, more specifically, to the preference for immediate utility over delayed utility” (p. 352). As such, time discounting may be seen as the reason, while time preference may be the preference. Like temporal preferences and orientations, there is individual variation in discount rates and the degree of bias towards the present (Sawe & Chawla, 2021). Perhaps more surprisingly, however, there also appears to be domain-specific discounting, with temporal discounting being less pronounced for environmental issues than for personal health or financial risks (Gattig & Henrickx, 2007), thus being “partly immune to time perspective” (Böhm & Pfister, 2005, p. 461), the concept discussed in Section 2. The evidence remains mixed: on the one hand, numerous studies show the more delayed environmental consequences are, or are perceived to be, the less importance people attribute to these consequences (Hardisty & Weber, 2009; Pahl et al., 2014). On the other hand, some studies show the opposite effect, with increased temporal and spatial distance (as part of PD concept) leading to more worrying and perceived probability for environmental problems (Pahl et al. 2014).\nProviding further nuance, thanks to more recent psychological and neuroeconomic advances, the concept of intertemporal choice has emerged as the decision between smaller, sooner rewards versus larger, later ones, which better accounts for “decisions with consequences that play out over time” (Berns et al., 2007, p. 482). Given the complexities of the delayed climate impacts detailed earlier, as well as the more upfront costs of individual and collective climate mitigation behaviors, the function of intertemporal choice is therefore to provide insight within a more economic conceptual framework into why individuals and societies struggle to take effective action on climate change. Indeed, viewed through this lens, environmental decisions are trade-offs between uncertain future benefits and certain present sacrifices. In such a priming study, the longer past a country was perceived to have, the longer its perceived future was, thus motivating participants to donate more to an environmental organization (Hershfield et al., 2014). Sawe and Chawla (2021) interpret this finding as the longer future priming increasing the potential impact and salience of environmental action, thus explaining the discounting of climate change risks and helping to reduce this discounting, thereby increasing pro-environmental behavior.\nWithin the realm of intertemporal choice, two closely related concepts—(1) hyperbolic discounting, championed in the context of climate change by Karp (2005), and (2) intra- and intergenerational discounting—aim to further contextualize our ongoing temporal struggles with climate change mitigation. Hyperbolic discounting, a cognitive bias within the individual intertemporal decision-making process, may perhaps sound more familiar as ‘instant gratification’ and deserves mention, but essentially encapsulates the same idea as temporal discounting with only minor modification (Rubinstein, 2003). Instead, the concept of intergenerational discounting, which operates beyond individual-level decision-making, better captures the indeed intergenerational nature of climate change, as “the present generation bears the costs of cooperation, whereas future generations accrue the benefits if present cooperation succeeds or suffer if present cooperation fails” (Jacquet et al., 2013). A recent study identified lack of knowledge and information for high intergenerational discounting outcomes, counterintuitively finding that higher awareness, and not monetary incentives, were key to incentivizing climate change behaviors (Alvi et al., 2023)."

    "text": "4.5 Conclusion\nMost of the concepts and studies reviewed above, akin to complexities in human sense-making of time and behavior, are closely interrelated. Therefore, we briefly turn to overarching approaches and intervention strategies that seem the most promising for specifically reducing these temporal challenges in the context of climate change behavior. The overarching approach emerging from the literature is the importance of targeting individuals’ personal and social associations through more salient temporal framings. For example, with recent technological advancements, such as Virtual Reality (VR), individuals can see their own future selves in the more climate-impacted world (Hershfield, 2011) or their local community (Sheppard et al., 2011), thus increasing CFC, individual future perspective, and reducing PD and discounting. This personalization approach, along with perspective-taking approaches on how those similar to us might be affected as well (Pahl et al., 2014), increase the saliency of impacts and thus the concreteness and immediacy in peoples’ minds. Significantly more future psychological research, especially with higher effect sizes and external validity, is needed to continue disentangling the temporal dimension of climate change behavior."

    "title": "5  Factors in Climate Change Belief Formation",
    "section": "5.1 Intro",
    "text": "5.1 Intro\nBeliefs about climate change - whether it’s caused by humans, and whether it exists in the first place - vary across the United States (Marlon et al., 2022). As a result, it’s important to consider how these variations in belief come to be, both via how they form in the first place and how they may change over time. The psychology literature in general gives us a wide range of cognitive biases to explore and insights into how each one operates and affects beliefs, but climate change-specific psychology literature is much sparser. As a result, this chapter focuses on just a few aspects of the belief updating process and factors that affect it.\nWe first discuss motivated reasoning, a major factor that influences belief in climate change. The process of forming and updating their beliefs with the goal of arriving at a specific belief has been shown to affect how individuals update their beliefs about climate change topics, suggesting that mitigating motivated reasoning may help promote more accurate and rational climate belief updating. Some studies take steps towards confirming this hypothesis, providing first steps towards understanding how factors that negatively affect climate change beliefs can be mitigated.\nThe chapter then switches to information reception and misinformation susceptibility, analyzing how misinformation is taken into account in individuals’ beliefs and potentially repeated and spread. Much like the literature surrounding motivated reasoning, much of the misinformation literature surrounds political polarization topics in general. However, many climate change psychology papers (such as in Hart and Nisbet (2012) and Caddick and Feist (2022), discussed later) show political polarization to be correlated with climate beliefs, and thus these topics are closely tied. Additionally, the factors that correlate with susceptibility to misinformation tend to be similar to the factors driving motivated reasoning. Beyond the effects of misinformation, we find work that demonstrates potential counters to the effects of misinformation, which also have some overlap with motivated reasoning.\nFinally, we discuss some Bayesian methods to model belief updating. One such paper discusses a general framework for updating individual beliefs from the prior belief to the posterior belief given new information, and demonstrates how the framework clarifies the potential for cognitive biases to be incorrectly assumed. On the other hand, another paper demonstrates a Bayes net approach to modeling climate change beliefs, and shows that the Bayes net can capture the effects of various factors on climate change beliefs regardless of whether cognitive biases such as motivated reasoning came into play. As a result, we can consider potential methods to identify the most influential factors on climate change beliefs and prioritize studying either how those factors influence climate change beliefs or how to mitigate any negative effects of those factors on belief.\nMotivated reasoning, misinformation, and Bayesian belief modeling are, at first glance, somewhat disparate topics. However, susceptibility to misinformation seems to be driven at least in part by motivated reasoning, both of which are factors that influence individuals’ climate change beliefs. And, taking a step back at climate beliefs as a whole, belief modeling is a powerful tool that can allow us to more deeply understand the influences of factors such as motivated reasoning and misinformation."

    "section": "5.2 Motivated Reasoning",
    "text": "5.2 Motivated Reasoning\nWhen individuals consider new information that differs from their current beliefs about the world, they may have a goal in mind. Any instance of this is known as motivated reasoning, as the individual is motivated by a goal when reasoning about their beliefs and new information. Typically, this is an accuracy goal: the attempt to come to the most accurate belief possible relative to the ground truth of the matter. This goal is non-directional, as the individual does not attempt to direct their reasoning towards any specific goal, and also requires significant cognitive overhead in order to process and analyze information more deeply. However, the individual may also have a directional goal, where they bias their reasoning in an attempt to arrive at a predetermined conclusion (Z. Kunda, 1990). This is not simply concluding that their desired belief is correct - rather, they must come up with ways, whether consciously or subconsciously, to find evidence supporting their belief, bringing in other cognitive factors. One such cognitive factor is a confirmation bias, which is distinct from, but overlaps with, motivated reasoning. Klayman (1995) discusses multiple ways that confirmation biases may occur: for instance, initial overconfidence may lead to continued overconfidence in the belief even after evidence is appropriately considered. Similarly related to motivated reasoning, the prior attitude effect is the effect by which individuals assess the trustworthiness of new information based on how well it aligns with their predetermined directional goal. One such example of this effect is a study by Taber and Lodge (2006), which found that in a politically polarized setting, the prior attitude effect strongly affects individuals’ reception and processing of new information.\nHowever, to dive more specifically into climate psychology, we first must address the effects that motivated reasoning has on climate change beliefs. Literature surrounding motivated reasoning’s effects on climate change psychology is somewhat sparse, but some studies do exist. For instance, the study by Hart and Nisbet (2012) on climate mitigation policies found that the introduction of social distance between subjects and the victims of climate change effects caused Democrats to increase their support of, and Republicans to decrease their support of, climate mitigation policies, relative to the control of no social distance message activation. They claim that this is due to the effects of motivated reasoning in terms of issue support. However, it is also possible that belief in human-induced global warming was the driving force behind the motivated reasoning effect, as this factor was stronger than the political partisanship factor in their models. In any case, it seems reasonable to conclude from Hart and Nisbet’s study that there does exist some sort of influence that motivated reasoning has on support of climate change policies. This is separate from belief, but arguably stronger than belief as it’s a specific action that presumably would require belief in climate change as a prerequisite.\nAside from motivated reasoning’s effects on individuals’ tendency towards climate action, motivated reasoning also seems to have effects on social cognition. Nir (2011) studied motivated reasoning’s social effects with the starting assumption of relevance being that the public, rather than individuals, form opinions as a whole. The study goes on to find that, in the political setting, individuals with directional goals tend to overestimate public support while individuals with accuracy goals tend to underestimate public support for political opinions. Although not specifically climate change-related, climate change psychology and motivated reasoning has been tied to political polarization in many of the articles discussed in this chapter, and this concept is discussed in further length in the Social Identity chapter. As a result, it’s not unreasonable to argue for extending Nir’s result to the polarized subject of climate change belief.\nThe studies discussed thus far have presumed motivated reasoning as the default method of non-rational belief updating in their experimental designs; one could argue that they should instead investigate whether motivated reasoning (as opposed to any other effects) are the actual drivers of the non-rational belief updating. Thaler (2020) attempted to address this issue by designing an experiment surrounding trust in news to identify motivated reasoning, starting with the assumption of standard Bayesian belief updating. Although it considers only individuals’ reception of articles in a vacuum, without considering the effect of external factors such as the source of the news articles, Thaler claims that this study results in a potential framework to identify whether motivated reasoning is a factor in individuals’ belief updating processes. As a result, it may be reasonable to apply this same framework to studies such as those discussed previously to better certify that motivated reasoning was truly the driving force in the studies’ results.\nWith the effects of motivated reasoning on climate change better understood, we must understand factors that promote motivated reasoning in order to then lower the impacts of motivated reasoning. One such study, by Caddick and Feist (2022), did exactly this: they searched for predictors of motivated reasoning in the climate change setting. By presenting two fictional scientists’ articles on climate change (one for and one against human-driven climate change, but both with equally flawed reasoning), they found support for the hypotheses that cognitive style, personality, and ideology were predictors of motivated reasoning. Although the effect size was small and many factors were interrelated, they found that dogmatism and authoritarianism/conservatism/traditionalism increased motivated reasoning effects, while individuals with higher dispositional anxiety correlated with lower motivated reasoning effects. However, individuals with higher “adoption of scientific attitudes” and “need for cognition” were not found to show a greater degree of motivated reasoning. Additionally, the study objectively defined motivated reasoning by quantifying how balanced the participants were in identifying both the strengths and weaknesses of both articles: for instance, a high motivated reasoning score was assigned to subjects who focused primarily of the weaknesses of the view they disagreed with and the strengths of the view they agreed with. Because the study quantifies motivated reasoning this way, it provides a fairly strong argument for its findings.\nStenhouse et al. (2018) studied a singular factor: investigating the effects of Actively Open-Minded Thinking (AOT) on mitigating partisanship-driven motivated reasoning, where AOT is defined as “the tendency to evaluate arguments and evidence without undue bias from one's own prior beliefs” (Mellers et al., 2015). Inversely, low tendency for AOT means higher bias from one’s prior beliefs, and therefore a stronger tendency to be biased towards maintaining prior beliefs, while high tendency for AOT also means increased active processing of information counter to the individual’s current belief. When investigating the effects of AOT, Stenhouse et al. found a correlation between higher AOT tendencies and higher belief in human-caused global warming, notably regardless of political ideology or scientific knowledge.\nWith directional motivated reasoning established as a relevant factor in climate change belief formation and an understanding of the factors that correlate with tendencies towards directional goals, we can approach how to promote accuracy-driven reasoning, or even mitigate motivated reasoning entirely. Redlawsk et al. (2010) investigated an “affective tipping point” in the context of political opinions which, after being reached, drives individuals around their goal-oriented motivated reasoning to more accurately update their beliefs. Their study centered around individuals’ voting behavior towards candidates that they hold a positive affect towards. Typically, motivated reasoning would drive these individuals to strengthen their opinion of their candidate regardless of new information; however, Redlawsk et al. found that there was a threshold of new, negative information caused individuals to switch to accuracy-driven or rational reasoning, hypothesized to be due to the anxiety caused by cognitive dissonance.\nSimilarly, Gehlbach et al. (2019) investigated an intervention to promote cognitive consistency. They began by noting that people often engage in a form of motivated reasoning in order to maintain consistency with the beliefs of others in their social network, which is one factor that causes climate change skepticism. To counteract this effect, they primed their subjects’ via a survey of the subjects’ general science beliefs; subsequently, primed conservative subjects tended to report higher belief in climate change than unprimed conservatives subjects. This result suggests an alternative intervention to Redlawsk et al.’s proposition: instead of overloading individuals with information, prime them to think about their beliefs in science in general in order to promote climate change beliefs.\nAlthough the literature of motivated reasoning’s relationships to climate change beliefs are limited overall, the studies that exist show that individuals do have a tendency to engage in motivated reasoning to guide the development of their climate change beliefs. This can be problematic because higher levels of motivated reasoning imply a lower drive towards an accuracy goal, in turn meaning that individuals become unconsciously less interested in understanding the actual scientific consensus on climate change. Multiple factors have been implicated in individuals’ likelihoods to engage in motivated reasoning, but one consistent factor has been political affiliation. Simply understanding these factors is not enough to drive actionable change in individuals beliefs; however, other studie&lt;s such as the two discussed, go on to directly investigate the efficacy of various potential interventions to decrease the effects of motivated reasoning. These seem to go in two directions: one discusses the continual introduction of information until it effectively “overloads” the effects of motivated reasoning, and the other promotes a certain style of thinking, though it only serves as an introduction to the topic and does not fully discuss how the intervention may be applied. These results suggest that, although not necessarily well fleshed out, there may be potential ways to mitigate the known effects of motivated reasoning on individuals’ climate change beliefs."

    "title": "5  Factors in Climate Change Belief Formation",
    "section": "5.3 Information & misinformation",
    "text": "5.3 Information & misinformation\nUp to this point, we’ve primarily discussed how individuals decide whether to use presented information to update their belief, with the implicit assumption that any information that they do use to update their belief is true. However, this is a strong assumption - misinformation as a whole has frequently been in the recent news, covering topics from elections to COVID, and climate misinformation is no different. Additionally, public perception of the news has followed: trust in both national and local news has significantly decreased in the past 8 years (Watson, 2022). As a result, it’s important to consider the relationships between misinformation and individuals’ beliefs.\nTreen et al. (2020) provide a comprehensive review of climate change misinformation that serves as a good overview and introduction to the topic. They begin by defining misinformation as misleading information, regardless of intent to mislead, and discuss the variety of actors (such as governments and industries) that are involved in climate science denial (and thus climate misinformation). They then discuss how this climate change misinformation spreads and what its effects are. First, they note confirmation bias as one of the primary psychological factors contributing to individuals’ decisions to spread misinformation, but find that there’s little research regarding the spread of climate misinformation in particular. From this brief introduction, we can begin to see the correlations between motivated reasoning and misinformation susceptibility. Continuing in the review, the effects of climate change misinformation discussed are detailed: creation of doubts about the existence and urgency of climate change as well as validity of climate change scientists, increase in political polarization, and emotional responses are all results of climate misinformation within the population misinformation susceptibility.\nTo understand the interactions between misinformation and climate change beliefs more deeply, we first have to understand how misinformation spreads and is consumed by individuals. Key factors influencing susceptibility to fake news, and its relationship to political partisanship, were investigated by Pennycook and Rand (2019). Generally, they found that a higher propensity for analytical reasoning positively correlated with the ability to distinguish between real and fake news, both full articles and headlines, regardless of partisanship, but this ability was stronger for news articles that were ideologically aligned with the subject. From this, they concluded that partisan bias is likely only a partial driver of fake news susceptibility, and instead suggest that individuals who are susceptible to fake news simply do not bother to actively reason about the veracity of news articles and headlines. In other words, the key takeaway is not necessarily that there is any motivation to believe misinformation, but there is no accuracy goal, either: individuals who are susceptible to misinformation simply don’t put in effort to determine their trust in the information.\nOn the other hand, some studies do draw relationships between political polarization and misinformation susceptibility. Traberg and van Linden (2022) also investigated factors that make individuals more susceptible to believing misinformation, and their key results highlighted the same importance of political polarization found throughout most papers discussed in this chapter: individuals are more susceptible to misinformation when the source presented to them aligns with their previous political ideologies. Similarly, Van der Linden (2022) looked into susceptibility to misinformation, as well as the spread of and immunization against misinformation, in their conceptual review. Their review found two primary factors for misinformation susceptibility: insufficient consideration of accuracy cues and motivation to reinforce social/political identities and beliefs. Likelihood to spread misinformation was especially affected by the latter factor, but van der Linden notes that most online misinformation originates from relatively few accounts (e.g. superspreaders).\nMuch like the subject of motivated reasoning, there’s little recent research on the interactions between misinformation and climate change. However, the previously mentioned studies discuss misinformation in the context of politically polarized topics and especially COVID-19. As a result, it’s reasonable to draw parallels to climate misinformation, as climate change psychology heavily implicates political polarization as a major factor in belief. And, in the case of COVID-19, both subjects are highly politicized despite being grounded in scientific consensus. So, although not the exact same subject, these studies cover similar enough topics to draw reasonable initial conclusions. All these considerations taken into account, there are two major themes: directional goals of socio-political identity reinforcement (i.e. political affiliation/polarization) and lack of accuracy goals are the key drivers of misinformation susceptibility. In other words, interventions to reduce the effects of directionally motivated reasoning may assist with decreasing misinformation susceptibility.\nAs with motivated reasoning, understanding what makes individuals susceptible to misinformation is an important first step, but understanding how to prevent susceptibility to misinformation is necessary for more accurate belief updating. The following studies further investigate interventions to reduce misinformation susceptibility, and begin by defining the term “inoculations” for preventative steps prior to misinformation exposure.\nIn the previously discussed review, Treen et al. also proposed methods to combat climate misinformation. Two possibilities can operate on the individual level, as discussed later in this section: inoculation against misinformation and directly combating misinformation by correcting misinformation with facts. Two other possibilities operate on a platform, rather than individual, level by preventing individuals from interacting with misinformation in the first place by either rapidly detecting malicious accounts or better ranking algorithms. These platform-level interventions inherently depend on the platform’s cooperation, and thus have a much higher barrier to study and implementation, but have the potential to be wider-spread and thus may be more powerful at a population level.\nVan der Linden (2022), in their previously mentioned paper, argues that pre-exposure misinformation inoculations are at least as important as post-exposure inoculations due to the lasting effects of misinformation exposure. In fact, their best-practice inoculation recommendation has four parts: introduce the facts of the situation, warn about the misinformation specific to those facts, explain why the misinformation is incorrect, and reinforce the original facts and explanation. They note some possible drawbacks, including potential backfiring (having individuals reinforce their belief in the misinformation), inoculations struggle to have the same reach as the original misinformation, and even after acknowledging that misinformation is incorrect, individuals may still base beliefs on that misinformation. The latter two are factors that diminish the potential full effect of inoculations. However, the first potential drawback is potentially an effect of motivated reasoning, and may be able to be dealt with through a motivated reasoning lens.\nVan der Linden et al. (2017) studied climate change misinformation interventions as well by introducing the idea of inoculation against climate change misinformation, defined in their paper by forewarning individuals of potential misinformation and preemptively debunking misinformation. They separate these types of misinformation inoculation into general and detailed inoculation, designating how specific the forewarning and debunking statements were. Their study began with the base knowledge that communicating the existence of scientific consensus on climate change helps people believe that the scientific consensus exists, and finds that the misinformation does indeed have a negative effect on that belief regardless of whether the initial positive communication existed. It also found that both general and detailed inoculations against climate misinformation helps negate the effect of misinformation on that belief. It’s important to note that van der Linden et al. studied effects on belief in scientific consensus as a proxy for individuals’ beliefs in climate change.\nOne platform-level intervention was studied by Lutzke et al. (2019): specifically, interventions for climate change misinformation on Facebook. Having subjects read a series of guidelines for evaluating news online (i.e. priming them to be exposed to misinformation) caused a reduced likelihood of both believing and repeating fake news about climate change, but didn’t reduce likelihood to to believe or repeat legitimate news. Their study found small but significant effect sizes, and they make the reasonable claim that even small effect sizes are still important at the scales that misinformation on Facebook operates on.\nMisinformation is a tricky subject: when considering it alone, without even considering its effects on consumers, there are many variables: how it’s shared, the underlying intent behind its creator, and its spread, just to name a few. However, it’s an extremely salient factor in the conversation surrounding climate change belief, and has been shown to both exist and have effects on individuals’ beliefs. As a result, we focus on its effects on individuals, disregarding the platform-level issues of how misinformation spreads. Misinformation susceptibility, as with motivated reasoning, is highly correlated with political polarization and has a significant effect on climate change belief. However, there are interventions that have the potential to decrease the effects of misinformation on climate change beliefs, and even small effect sizes in the studies may have major impacts at high volumes of misinformation as seen today. Additionally, motivated reasoning seems to be a potentially strong factor in misinformation susceptibility, and thus provides another set of potential interventions to mitigate the issue."

    "section": "5.4 Belief updating",
    "text": "5.4 Belief updating\nWe’ve now discussed the effects of motivated reasoning and misinformation on climate change belief updating in depth, and have proposed potential interventions that can mitigate these negative effects. However, the idea of belief updating itself has been poorly defined, and in this section, we will discuss frameworks by which to model belief updating and better understand how the effects of motivated reasoning and misinformation may modify belief updating.\nBayesian belief updating, based on Bayes’ rule, is a general framework to model the evolution of a belief (i.e. the posterior belief) given a prior belief and new evidence related to the belief. Bayes’ rule declares that P(H | D) = (P(H) * P(D | H)) / P(D) where H is the hypothesis and D is the evidence, or data. Here, we call P(H) the prior belief, P(D | H) the (data) likelihood, P(D) the marginal likelihood, and P(H | D) the posterior (or updated) belief. Typically, we ignore the marginal likelihood due to the infeasibility of calculating the probability of the new evidence as a whole, and instead say that the posterior belief is proportional to the prior multiplied by the likelihood. This model is purely “rational” in the sense that only the likelihood is considered when updating from the prior to the posterior.\nThis Bayesian updating framework also has the potential to model irrational belief updates, such as those in climate change, as illustrated by Druckman and McGrath (2019). They define the prior belief as the currently existing belief regarding any given climate change topic, and model the prior as a normal distribution with a mean centered at the individual’s current belief and a variance based on the individual’s uncertainty around their belief. They continue to model new information that comes in - seemingly merging the likelihood and marginal likelihood into one distribution - as being sampled from another normal distribution. These two distributions can then be combined via Bayesian inference rules, forming a posterior belief that is a function of the prior belief distribution and the incoming information distribution. The choice of the normal distribution used in the described model is somewhat arbitrary, chosen under the assumption that these distributions are indeed normal. However, replacing one distribution with another is straightforward, as the Bayesian update rule will work for any continuous distribution.\nThe most salient point that Druckman and McGrath make is that the distribution of new information, used to update the individual’s prior belief, can be affected in a variety of ways. They begin with the assumption that, ideally, the distribution of new information is centered around the ground truth of the issue, and that the variance is based on the individual’s perception of the credibility of incoming information. This standard method is in line with the idea of an accuracy goal in motivated reasoning, as individuals update their beliefs with the goal of approaching the most accurate possible belief.\nThe distribution of new information can then be used to more formally understand the effects of directional goals, but also how other effects may be mistaken for directional goals. One such example of the effects of a directional goal, confirmation bias causes a re-centering of the distribution of new information at the center of the individual’s prior belief, meaning that new information is likely to reinforce the prior belief. Another example is the prior attitude effect, described by Druckman and McGrath as the individual's perceived confidence of new information being positively correlated with the similarity of that information to the individual's prior belief. Here, an accuracy goal may be mistaken for a directional goal: for instance, if the individual has low trust in science but high trust in a news source, they may reject science reports in favor of misleading news, which is due to an accuracy goal yet may seem to be directionally motivated. More generally, Druckman and McGrath describe the issue of directional versus accuracy goals as an issue with understanding trust: an individual with an accuracy goal may seem to be affected by motivated reasoning if they primarily trust sources that already share their views.\nAt first glance, the article by Cook and Lewandowsky (2016) discusses similar concepts using a Bayesian framework. However, rather than discussing updating prior distributions into posterior distributions, they analyze the factors of belief updating in the context of a Bayes belief net: a directed graph of causal variables that can be used to understand how various factors influence the distribution or likelihood of a variable in question. In the context of climate change beliefs, Cook and Lewandowsky create a “worldview Bayes net” to model the interactions between the factors in a four-variable Bayes net. It’s important to note that this method measured individuals’ perceived scientific consensus on climate change rather than directly measuring individuals’ belief in that scientific consensus. However, their method still displayed important results. Directly, they found that climate change belief updating was a function of individuals’ support of free-market ideals (as a proxy for political affiliation) and thus belief updating is dependent on political polarization. But, further and more relevant to the underlying belief updating process, Cook and Lewandowsky showed that Bayes nets can be used to capture the effects of potentially “irrational” belief updates, such as the effects of politically-driven motivated reasoning, in a standard Bayesian setting.\nThese two papers taken together demonstrate something striking: there is potential to model climate change belief updating, taking into account any number of factors, using standard Bayesian models, and thus the direct possibility from those models to more deeply understand the impact of various factors on individuals’ belief updates - regardless of “rationality” of those factors. However, Druckman and McGrath note that it can be difficult to differentiate accuracy and directional goals in the Bayesian setting, while Cook and Lewandowsky’s model does not depend on this accurate differentiation. So, Bayesian modeling may not necessarily expose why certain factors are so influential - such as whether they’re influential due to motivated reasoning versus due to secondary effects, as discussed by Druckman and McGrath - but instead the process simply highlights which factors are key to belief updating processes. Then, using this modeling as guidance to understand which factors to study more deeply can then lead to more targeted interventions to maximize the ability of interventions to promote accurate climate change beliefs."

    "section": "5.5 Conclusion",
    "text": "5.5 Conclusion\nWhen considering the broad problem of climate change, one key step is understanding how individuals generate their beliefs about climate change, and especially understanding what factors cause individuals to hold inaccurate beliefs about climate change. The immediate next step is then to understand how to “correct” these factors to promote accurate climate change beliefs. In this chapter, we have explored the effects of motivated reasoning on climate beliefs, the relationship between motivated reasoning and misinformation, and methods to mitigate the effects of the two; we have also discussed two potential Bayesian models of climate belief updates.\nMotivated reasoning was demonstrated to be a major underlying factor that influences climate beliefs away from being accurate. As a first step, multiple factors were found to be correlated with individuals’ likelihood to engage in motivated reasoning, especially political polarization. But, beyond just identifying these factors, it is important to mitigate motivated reasoning’s effects in order to guide individuals to more accurate beliefs about climate change. Some studies do indeed address potential interventions to mitigate the effects of motivated reasoning through two somewhat opposite methods: either simply overloading the individual with information until cognitive dissonance discomfort causes them to simply drop their directional goal, or by promoting thinking styles that make individuals less likely to engage in motivated reasoning.\nTo those engaged with the news in the past seven to eight years, misinformation is clearly an issue that has major implications, and climate misinformation is no exception. The factors that make individuals susceptible to motivated reasoning seem to be closely tied to those that are correlated with motivated reasoning, in part due to individuals’ directional goals and in part due to their lack of accuracy goals. So, interventions that may mitigate the effects of directional goals may assist with reducing misinformation susceptibility. Interventions more directly focused on misinformation have been also proposed that may mitigate the effects of misinformation, both at an individual and a platform level.\nBayesian modeling helps frame the concepts of misinformation and motivated reasoning in the same context with the idea of belief updates: taking in new information and using it to form a new belief about a subject based on that new information and your previous belief. Although the models demonstrate that it may not be easy to clarify whether factors such as motivated reasoning are what cause seemingly “irrational” belief updates, they nonetheless can capture the effects of any potential irrational belief updating and can therefore be a powerful tool to identify factors that contribute to seemingly irrational belief updating, helping to prioritize climate psychology research."

    "text": "6.1 Executive Summary\nStudies assessing different intervention types of climate change beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors are prevalent, but there is still a lot to be done to determine which interventions are most effective. Within the area of belief and attitude, there is a general consensus that interventions should be targeted towards conservatives and climate skeptics, and psychological distance perceptions, economic arguments, and political and moral framing appear promising in their ability to change climate beliefs and attitudes. Behavioral interventions on individual/household behaviors broadly seem to be best conducted through the use of social comparison and social norms, although there is some question of the overall efficacy of behavioral interventions, and more work needs to be done to determine whether the effects of these interventions last."

    "section": "6.2 Introduction",
    "text": "6.2 Introduction\nUsing some of the context of the preceding chapters, and with the general goal of considering how psychological knowledge and perspectives can help with the climate crisis, this chapter will focus on psychological interventions around climate change. Broadly, these types of interventions can be categorized into two groups: interventions on beliefs and attitudes around climate change, and interventions targeting personal behavior change. This chapter will discuss the state of the literature on these different types of interventions, while considering how intervention importance and efficacy should be measured, and will conclude by describing the limitations of the current psychological intervention literature and suggestions for future research. Notably, this chapter exists in conjunction with link Catherine’s chapter, which focuses specifically on behavior change around collective action.\n\n6.2.1 Considering Intervention Importance and Efficacy\nResponses to climate change come in the forms of both mitigation, in other words, changing systems such that greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of environmental destruction are mitigated, and adaptation, which involves adjusting behaviors and actions to adapt to the climatic changes that are already occurring. Both mitigation and adaptation are necessary at this time, given that climate change has already had drastic effects on many places and communities and will continue to even as mitigation steps are being taken. However, adaptation is a process that is essentially reactive to lack of mitigation, in other words, the more climate change mitigation occurs, the less adaptation will need to occur (Rojas, 2019).\nFor this reason, and because this book focuses on the United States, which produces the second-highest amount of emissions worldwide, this chapter will focus exclusively on psychological interventions around climate change mitigation. Mitigation is defined as reducing the levels of greenhouse gasses — particularly carbon dioxide — in the atmosphere, both by reducing current and future emissions and increasing resources that can draw down and store these gasses (NASA, 2023).\nPsychological interventions that focus on behavior change are often able to directly calculate mitigation — almost always emissions reductions — by using knowledge of the emissions associated with the behavior and the measured change in behavior. However, interventions around belief and intention to act are unable to directly measure emissions reductions, as the thing being intervened on is not directly linked to any sort of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, some of the reviews and meta-analyses discussed in this chapter focus on pro-environmental behaviors (broadly defined, behaviors that affect environmental quality, including recycling and littering as well as energy usage (Steg and Vlek, 2009)) more generally, rather than just on emissions reductions.\nThese discrepancies make it difficult and beyond the scope of this chapter to rank all intervention types based on their resulting emissions reductions. However, by approaching the literature on psychological interventions around climate change with the general framework of prioritizing emissions reductions, some light can be shed on which interventions appear most promising for achieving this goal.\n\n\n6.2.2 Intervention Types\nIn broad terms, the climate change intervention literature that we will be focusing on in this chapter can be categorized into two types: interventions on views around climate change (belief, attitude) and interventions on behavior (intention to act, individual action, collective action). Searches on sites like Google Scholar using keywords such as ‘climate change’ and ‘psychological interventions’ also result in interventions around the negative mental health effects of climate change. While important, the focus of these interventions does not relate to the goal of emissions mitigation previously described in this chapter, thus, we will not be focusing on this type of intervention."

    "section": "6.3 Belief and Attitude Interventions",
    "text": "6.3 Belief and Attitude Interventions\nDespite a clear scientific consensus on the anthropogenic roots of climate change, as of 2020, in the US, only 61% of registered voters believe that climate change is largely human-caused.\nAdditionally, beliefs around the existence of climate change are heavily split along party lines — only 30% of conservative Republicans believe in anthropogenic climate change (Leiserowitz et al., 2020). Additionally, support for specific policies around energy and emissions varies; generally, Republicans and particularly conservative Republicans are less supportive of climate-related policies than Democrats and Independents (Rode et al., 2021).\nAs a result, a number of interventions have focused on changing beliefs and attitudes around climate change. For more information specifically about climate change-related belief formation and updating, see link Matthew’s chapter. In this section, we will begin a high-level overview of the state of the literature on belief and attitude interventions, and which have appeared to be most successful. This will be followed by a discussion of whether and why altering climate change beliefs and attitudes are important for achieving emissions reductions.\n\n6.3.1 High-Level Discussion of Interventions\nOne meta-analysis considered 76 different interventions conducted in the United States that sought to change either beliefs around climate change or attitudes around climate policy. It found that interventions have a positive effect on attitudes around climate change, and that beliefs in climate change are more susceptible to intervention than attitudes around climate policy (Rode et al., 2021).\nNotably, this meta-analysis also considered interventions with the goal of decreasing climate beliefs, and found that the effect that these negative interventions had on decreasing beliefs was stronger than the effect that positive interventions had on increasing climate change belief (Hedge’s g: -0.29 and 0.08, respectively). The larger effect size of decreased belief is important to consider, although discouraging, when one considers the spread of misinformation about climate science (see link Matthew’s chapter for more on climate information). (Rode et al., 2021).\nOne chapter in a book on the partisan climate divide sought to answer similar questions about policy support and climate change beliefs, focusing specifically on how interventions differentially affect liberals and conservatives. It considered interventions focused on emotion, psychological distance, policy framing, and scientific consensus. Although the previously discussed meta-analysis did not find political views to be a significant moderator for intervention effectiveness (Rode et al., 2021), the review discussed a distinction between the effects of interventions on liberals and conservatives. With regard to liberals, the review paper noted a ceiling effect of climate-related interventions — support for climate policy stayed consistently high, regardless of intervention type (Rode and Ditto, 2021).\nFor conservatives, however, results were mixed, and detailed as follows. Decreasing perception of psychological distance — see (link Anaïs’ chapter) for more information about this topic — seemed to be consistently positive in terms of increasing climate beliefs and decreasing political polarization in a number of interventions. Attitudes around policy also seemed to be positively changed using policy framing devices. In particular, emphasis frames, which serve to shift the emphasis of policy away from climate change in particular and towards other frames like air pollution, generally increased conservative support for those policies. Source framing, in other words framing policies as coming from Republican or Democrat sources, had a positive effect when linked to specific policies, but did not have a consistent effect when sources were associated with more general climate messaging. Moral reframing, or shifting the wording or framing of a policy to reflect traditionally Republican moral viewpoints such as purity and authority, also appeared to have a consistently positive effect on conservatives’ climate change attitudes, although the review only described a few such studies, so more literature is needed in this area to draw more definitive conclusions. Economic messages were found to have mixed results, with some interventions producing very positive changes in climate beliefs and policy attitudes, and some finding that changes were moderated by other factors, such as the source of the messaging. Interventions leveraging emotions and scientific consensus had no consistent effects (Rode and Ditto, 2021).\n\n\n6.3.2 How Belief and Attitude Relate to Emissions Mitigation\nChanges in beliefs and attitudes around climate change don’t lead directly to emissions reductions, but the idea behind these interventions is that belief in climate change will lead to personal action and/or policy changes around climate change, and these will result in emissions mitigation.\nRegarding personal behavior, a recent meta-analysis found that belief in climate change is correlated with pro-environmental intentions (Hornsey et al., 2016). To a lesser extent, there is also a relationship between belief in climate change and pro-environmental behavior (Hornsey et al., 2016). This effect was smaller than that of the effect on intentions, a reflection of what is known as the “green gap” — a theory which posits that there is a gap between intention to act and actual behavior when it comes to pro-environmental actions (ElHaffar, 2020).\nThe green gap has been documented repeatedly in the climate behavior literature (ElHaffar, 2020), but one should note that its existence does not preclude any relationship of intention on action. For example, one meta-analysis considered studies that examined this difference and concluded that a “medium-to-large change in intention leads to a small-to-medium change in behavior” (Webb and Sheeran, 2006). Thus, to the extent that belief in climate change affects intention to act, it likely also has some effect on actual pro-environmental behavior.\nInfluencing policy support, and the voting associated with it, is distinct from the behavior (or lack thereof) described by the green gap. Obviously, however, policy support is a behavior which can have a significant effect on emissions, in the cases in which emissions reductions policies are supported. It is thus encouraging to note that the previously mentioned meta-analysis found that belief in climate change is also correlated with climate policy support (Hornsey et al., 2016).\nOverall, interventions that change beliefs and attitudes can have a positive effect on emissions reductions, albeit indirectly. In the next section, we turn to interventions that seek to change behavior, leading to more direct emissions reductions."

    "section": "6.4 Behavioral Interventions",
    "text": "6.4 Behavioral Interventions\nBehavior change in regards to climate change can come in the form of individual/household behavior change (changing consumption habits, household energy use, transportation habits, etc.) and in the form of participation in collective action (voting, attending protests, joining climate activism groups, etc.). The former type of intervention has a directly measurable impact on emissions, whereas the latter indirectly impacts emissions, via changes in governance and policy to regulate emissions from other sectors.\nClimate change is often cited as a quintessential example of the “tragedy of the commons”, in other words, if individual entities take actions which are best for themselves, the group as a whole will be worse off. This can be thought of both on the scale of countries, where individual countries are incentivized to continue polluting, but ultimately this results in worsening climate change, as well as on the scale of individual people within a country, in that there can be a significant cost to taking individual action against climate change, and very little benefit if other individuals do not also take similar actions. As a result, it is often argued that action should be taken at a level higher than the individual (i.e. via policy changes), although there are arguments that individuals should take action (e.g. Hourdequin, 2010).\nThe nature of climate change as a tragedy of the commons problem means that collective action to force changes on larger scales than the individual will be essential. Additionally, it is important to consider the fact that not everybody can afford to engage in individual climate action. Actions such as buying more fuel-efficient cars can be very costly, and lower-income individuals may have less ability to take such actions, further necessitating larger scale support and changes in infrastructure and policy. As a result, we have dedicated an entire chapter to the topic of behavior change around collective action (link Catherine’s chapter). The remainder of this chapter will focus on behavior change around individual/household level actions.\n\n6.4.1 Quantifying Impact\nAs mentioned, collective action and changes in higher-level policies and regulations will be a critical component of mitigating carbon emissions. However, actions taken on the level of households and even individuals also have the potential to play a role in mitigation.\nA frequently-cited article from 2009 estimates the reasonably achievable emissions reductions (or RAER) from changes in sources of direct energy emissions. This includes upgrading heating and HVAC systems, buying a more fuel-efficient vehicle, and increasing home weatherization, among other acts, all of which directly reduce the emissions created by day-to-day activities. The paper estimated the potential for emissions reductions based on the behavioral plasticity shown by the most effective interventions on these different activities. Using the stabilization wedges framework, which posits that 25 Gt emissions reductions in eight different sectors will be enough to stabilize the climate (Stabilization Wedges – Carbon Mitigation Initiative), the paper concludes that the RAER from direct household energy emissions is enough to make up 44% of the US’s stabilization wedges — in other words, reasonably achievable changes on the part of households can play a big part in emissions mitigation in the US (Dietz et al., 2009).\nThe numbers used in this paper have changed since it was written. Direct household emissions are now estimated to only make up 20% of the US’s total emissions, rather than the 38% statistic cited in the paper (Goldstein et al., 2020), and in terms of stabilization wedges, more progress has been made on ones associated with direct household energy use than other sectors, indicating that focus on other sectors may be more pressing now (Johnson et al., 2021). This is encouraging — it means that rapid progress has been made over the past 15 years in decreasing direct household emissions. It may lessen, to some extent, the impact that future changes in direct household emissions can make, as quantified by the paper. However, the general framework stands: a certain percentage of direct household emissions are reasonably achievable given the state of current interventions, and depending on these numbers, changes in household direct energy emissions in the US could play a significant role in the country’s total emissions reductions.\nMany other studies have sought to answer similar questions about the emissions impact of changes in individual behavior. For example, one study compared the emissions associated with seven different pro-environmental behaviors in North America and Europe, and found that overall, changes in diet (towards fewer meat products) had the largest emissions reduction potential, followed by changing to a more fuel-efficient vehicle. However, higher-income households could reduce emissions more by limiting air travel than any other behavior (Lacroix, 2018).\n\n\n6.4.2 Reviews and Meta-Analyses\nThere are a great number of studies that have sought to test the effects of various interventions on pro-environmental behavior. A number of meta-analyses and reviews have been conducted on different intervention types, so many, in fact, that a second order meta-analysis was also conducted to synthesize and analyze the information derived from hundreds of intervention studies. In this section, a few notable reviews and meta-analyses on climate interventions will be discussed.\nOne review paper considered three high-emissions behaviors in western economies — diet, personal vehicle usage, and household energy emissions — and associated interventions to estimate achievable emissions reductions through behavioral interventions. In so doing, they also identified the most promising types of interventions for each action: nudging for changes in diet (in particular, having the default option be plant-based), financial incentives for vehicle usage, and information-based/feedback interventions for household energy usage (Wynes et al., 2018).\nThe aforementioned second-order meta-analysis was published in 2023, and sought to identify whether, overall, behavioral interventions have an effect on pro-environmental behavior, as well as which interventions are most effective and which behaviors are easiest to intervene upon. With conservative adjustments for publication bias, a small but statistically significant average effect size was identified, and the authors note that even small effect sizes are meaningful in the context of scalable interventions (Bergquist et al., 2023).\nOf the intervention types considered, social comparison interventions were the most effective, followed by financial incentives. The behavior most susceptible to intervention was littering, followed by consumption, conservation, and recycling behaviors. Transportation behaviors were found to be the least changed by intervention (Bergquist et al., 2023). Notably, littering contributes very little in terms of greenhouse gas emissions compared with the other behaviors — as discussed in the previous section, consumption and transportation behaviors are the most impactful in terms of their potential for emissions reductions. However, the overall finding that interventions do have an effect, as well as an identification of social comparison interventions being most impactful, are optimistic.\nIn accordance with this last point, a 2021 review paper considered 58 articles and found that social norms consistently appear to have an influence on climate-related behaviors (including emissions-reducing behaviors like food choice and energy consumption, as well as more general pro-environmental behavior such as recycling). In multiple of the studies reviewed, aligned norm messaging (combining messaging about descriptive and injunctive norms) was found to be more effective than messaging about only one type of norm. The review also considers the moderating effects of group identity, conflicting environmental cues, and prior identification. Notably, two studies discussed in the review found that norms had a stronger effect on those who had identified less with the behavior prior to being exposed to the norms (Cialdini and Jacobson, 2021).\nA meta-analysis of resource conservation interventions also found that social influence has a positive effect on resource conservation compared to control conditions, and, to a lesser extent, compared to other interventions such as feedback (Abrahamse and Steg, 2013). Here, resource conservation includes energy conservation — directly related to emissions reductions — as well as recycling, which has a much smaller mitigation potential.\nConflicting with these results, one large-scale meta-analysis found very little effect of intervention on climate change related behaviors. This analysis excluded financial incentives as a form of intervention, but noted that interaction effects between economic incentives and other behavioral interventions may increase the efficacy of intervention. Importantly, the analysis also considered the persistence of behavior change, after the intervention period was over, and found that behaviors that must persist to have emissions reduction effects (such as food consumption choices) don’t continue following interventions (Nisa et al., 2019). Some behaviors, such as buying a more fuel-efficient car, are one-shot behaviors which need not continue to be implemented following intervention, however, for all those behaviors which must persist to have an effect, this is quite a discouraging result.\nHowever, an article recently came out critiquing the analysis techniques used in this paper. This article stated that the estimation procedure used that resulted in the discouraging conclusions — small effect size and low behavioral plasticity — was not recommended for the sort of data being analyzed in the meta-analysis. They further conducted effect size estimations using a number of different procedures, and found that in multiple cases, effect sizes were double those found by the original paper. They concluded by noting that, although effect sizes were still small, they were not nearly as small as found in the original paper, an encouraging note that becomes even more encouraging when one considers how small effect sizes can still make an impact when interventions are scaled up (van der Linden and Goldberg, 2020).\nOverall, the literature on behavior-change interventions around pro-environmental behaviors is positive. Most meta-analyses suggest that interventions can have an effect on behavior, and some point to social influence and norms-based interventions being the most impactful intervention types. This echoes other, theoretical arguments that have been made for the role that social norms can play in mitigating climate change (Sparkman et al., 2020).\nMore rigorous interventions, and more analyses of interventions, must be conducted to gain a better sense of the effects of these interventions on behavior change. Additionally, relatively few interventions measure the persistence of intervention effects following the intervention period (Nisa et al., 2019), and, for applicable behaviors, this must be further studied to gain a better sense of the longer-term impact of interventions."

    "text": "6.5 Conclusion\nIn general, studies assessing climate change related belief interventions have mixed results, and behavior interventions show small but positive effect sizes. More work needs to be done to draw more definitive conclusions about the efficacy of different intervention types for changing behavior and beliefs.\nFrameworks for new types of interventions are continually being suggested, for example, a recent review paper provides motivation and frameworks for evolutionary psychology based interventions (Palomo-Vélez and van Vugt, 2021). Importantly, as interventions continue to be tested, the possibility of spillover effects should be studied and looked out for, particularly in behavioral interventions. Spillover effects are negative behaviors which occur as a result of an intervention, but which are not the intended result, such as increased consumption of electricity following an efficiency upgrade, which could offset the resource conservation of the efficiency upgrade (Carrico, 2021).\nOverall, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the role that interventions could play in mitigating the climate crisis. More work needs to be done to study interventions and determine the most effective intervention types, but the literature suggests positive effects of interventions on climate-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors."

    "text": "7.1 Introduction\nIn addressing the perpetuation of non-climate-friendly behavior, it is crucial to understand the power of economic influence and large-scale organizational decision making. For this purpose, it is most appropriate to rely on game theory, or the study of the interacting strategies of agents in a competitive economic environment, to reveal the technicalities of these factors. While game theory is not generally considered a psychological field of study, its principles are relevant to the motivation behind much of the economical behavior displayed by individuals and organizations alike. Thus, game theory is an essential consideration in the effort to understand and confront the barriers to ubiquitous implementation of sustainable behaviors.\nPerhaps the most fundamental idea of game theory is that agents, or players, aim to choose the strategies that yield the greatest possible payoffs within the game—a game can be any situation in which agents receive a result from their choice of action, and the payoff is the agent’s subjective happiness with that received result (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Therefore, as long as it can be assumed that the game’s variables are all accounted for and the players of the game are rational actors, probabilities can be calculated and games tend to play out predictably. However, the game of climate change is not a predictable one. Not only are there a myriad of complex variables yet to be completely studied or even discovered, but the players of this game have not necessarily exhibited rationality either. Human beings have displayed widespread denial of their impact on Earth’s climate, or even of the existence of climate change entirely, as well as perpetuation of environmentally-destructive practices and behaviors. The sections below detail the aspects of climate change game theory on three different levels: (I) individual, (II) organizational, and (III) political."

    "section": "7.2 I. Game Theory for Individual Behavior",
    "text": "7.2 I. Game Theory for Individual Behavior\nWhile we may not realize it, game theory is a construct which hangs over the decisions we make, or the strategies we choose, on a daily basis. Whether the strategy is going to a further grocery store to find more affordable goods or showing up to a particular event to improve reputation in a social group, it all ultimately comes down to the maximization of payoffs. Putting this in the perspective of climate-friendly behavior, it can be interesting to observe the contrast between this payoff-maximizing prioritization and the kind of sustainable practices that we would like to encourage.\nOne factor from game theory which unfortunately does not support or encourage sustainable practices is the widespread irrationality in human behavior. As previously explained, rationality of agents in a game is critical to the game’s predictability and to the truly successful maximization of end payoffs. On average, people have shown to be poorly skilled at properly assessing the factors within their environment to calculate accurate potential payoffs, especially in the case of forecasting distant payoffs in conjunction with a long-term variable such as climate change (Camerer et al., 2015). This symptom of irrationality may be one of the key reasons why many of the people who accept the reality of climate change and agree that it is a problem do not actually alter their behavior to the degree that could lead to improved payoffs with respect to the environment. These types of people can be labeled as “free-riders,” as they are willing to enjoy the public good of the environment but leave all of the effort of climate change activism to the people around them (Wood 2011). Acknowledging this irrationality is important before further analysis.\nDealing with this downstream level of game theoretical analysis of individuals, there exist two primary forms of behavioral motivation: financial and social payoffs (Crawford et al., 2020). In this case, financial payoffs can simply be considered any incentives to wealth or financial stability, while social payoffs are a less defined measure of a person’s movement toward or away from their desired social standing. The two example strategies given before, traveling farther for affordable goods and showing up to important social events, show perfect examples of both financial and social payoffs in everyday, civilian games. Altering these strategies to fit under the lens of climate change related games, the first might instead be choosing to buy less-sustainably-produced goods over their more expensive counterparts for the financial payoff, while the second could be choosing to drive a gas-guzzling truck for the social payoff of fitting in with a particular social group. Clearly, neither of these actions are ideal for climate change activism, but they represent realistic and common behaviors that are not currently ridiculed en masse due to aforementioned pervasive irrationality.\nFortunately, game theory does present avenues for alteration of problematic behavior. Specifically for this case, manipulating the motivational variables can be an effective method of inducing favorable actions. While this is not as realistic for the social payoff motivation, as social norms are quite sticky and take time to develop and change, aiming to optimize financial payoffs in pair with sustainable behavior is a more feasible endeavor. Observe the figure below:\n\nThis is called a payoff matrix—a figure that helps economists visualize the possible payoffs of two interacting players in a single-round game. Here, we are modeling the first example of climate change related games discussed above, where the customer agent chose to buy cheaper goods over sustainably-produced goods. The numbers in the bottom-left of each box represent the payoffs of the customer, while those in the top-right represent the payoffs of the seller. By crossing the available strategies of the customer with that of the sellers, we can see that, if the sellers are somehow incentivized to price sustainable products below unsustainable products, there becomes a financial incentive for the customer to purchase only sustainable products. While this is no jaw-dropping declaration, it is an important dynamic to recognize in order to put effective interventions in motion. In fact, many meta-analyses of household data for finding effective climate change related interventions point to financial incentives as the primary motivational factor (Bergquist et al., 2023).\nTherefore, finding a way to align household sustainability with maximum financial payoff for the average person could be an effective method of establishing environmentally healthy behavioral norms on the individual level."

    "text": "7.3 II. Organizational Decision-Making & Corporate Strategy\nIn game theory, there are two main classifications of games when referring to the transparency of their variables: games of complete information and games of incomplete information. With games of complete information, all players have knowledge of all of the game’s variables, including the sequence of action, strategies and payoffs of other players, and any other parameters of the game. In contrast, players in games of incomplete information have lapses in this knowledge and don’t have total understanding of the game at play (EconPort). Of the two, climate change can be classified as a game of incomplete information due to the complexity and pure mass of information it involves. It can also be classified as another type of game: a public goods game. This is a scenario where agents pursue payoffs in the midst of a resource that is publicly available to everyone (Tomassini & Antonioni, 2020). These classifications are perhaps the most dangerous aspects of the game theory of climate change, as they compel players, particularly fossil fuels corporations, to rapidly consume the public good involved—Earth’s atmosphere and natural resources in this case—and pursue their maximum short-term payoffs without a full understanding of their long-term effects. By the time a comprehensive understanding of climate change variables comes to light, the steps taken in the wrong direction will not be able to be reversed, making the implementation of further environmental precaution in current practices an urgent issue. These factors will be discussed further below in association with the history of organizational policy in the United States.\nAcknowledging the power of financial variables on the individual level of game theory with respect to climate change, the organizational level pushes the prioritization of finances to an even higher degree. In particular, Oil and Gas (O&G) companies have not only denied their role in the increase of harmful greenhouse gasses in Earth’s atmosphere, but also have promoted irrational thought and misinformation about climate change on a massive scale since as early as 1980—all in an effort to maximize financial payoffs and maintain influence (Franta 2021). The misinformation strategy was effective for many years, and still has residual effects today despite a greater consensus on the existence of climate change (Mulvey et al., 2015), but the primary strategy of these corporations has now shifted to a more subtle approach: accepting the climate change discourse and publicizing a transition to clean energy.\nIn recent years, many of the major producers of fossil fuels, such as ExxonMobil and Shell, have put forth pledges to transition away from fossil fuels to more sustainable forms of energy. Unfortunately, these pledges are showing to more likely be strategies to mislead and deter sustainability activism rather than actual signals of change in company practices and goals. The skepticism arises from discrepancies between the statements made by these companies and the actions and investments that have truly been made (Li et al., 2022). This mismatch in climate discourse and action has become commonly referred to as “greenwashing,” and has undoubtedly slowed momentum for environmental activism. In doing this, corporations have stuck to a strategy which, similar to the individual level, prioritizes a maximization of financial payoffs. Different from the individual level, however, is the scale of the environmental impact of this strategy.\nAs of the year 2016, over 50% of global greenhouse gas emissions can be traced back to the operations of companies in the O&G sector (Ritchie & Roser, 2020). Compounding this massive output of emissions with the reluctance of O&G companies to make effective policy changes further emphasizes the extremity of the climate situation as a public goods game of incomplete information. With no reliable promise of change in the foreseeable future, the concepts of critical mass and tipping points become relevant to the conversation. Game theory is only one of many analytical fields to which these concepts are applicable. Critical mass is a measurement of the minimum level of a particular variable needed to spur and maintain some form of activity (Dodge 2012). There are no requirements on the quality of the variable in question; it can be a positive, negative, or neutral catalyst. When critical mass is reached in social cases, a behavioral tipping point is prompted into effect, whereby people are motivated to sustain a certain quality of behavior relevant to the critical mass variable (Dodge 2012). Introducing the lens of climate change to this concept, Earth will eventually reach a critical mass of poor atmospheric quality and depletion of natural resources which, in theory, should elicit a trend of self-sustaining climate-friendly organizational behavior (Tavoni & Iris, 2020). While this is a reassuring theory, it is far from ideal as compared to the goal of proactive widespread sustainability which would better preserve Earth’s most valued features, though more research should be conducted in order to pull tipping point theories further into the light."

    "text": "7.4 III. Domestic and International Political Game Theory\nIn discussing the relevance of game theory to climate change, it would be an extreme oversight to fail to recognize the role of political proceedings, both domestic and international. Domestically, funding records show that many political representatives are closely financially tied to the anti-sustainability O&G firms, very likely skewing their priorities in office (Goldberg et al., 2020). Internationally, influential countries try to balance the need to maintain energy production, exports, and military capability with the need to form emission-diminishing global climate agreements (Wood 2011). The game theoretical implications of these political dynamics are further explored below.\n\n7.4.1 Domestic\nIt is no secret that the issue of climate change has been politicized to the point of bipartisanship between Democrats and Republicans. In a survey of Americans from both parties conducted by the nonprofit organization Resources for the Future, 94 percent of Democrats agreed with the statement, “The world’s temperature will probably go up over the next 100 years,” as opposed to just 56 percent of Republicans (Krosnick 2020). This discrepancy did not arise by chance, but rather due to the influence of political game theory in the United States. Public records of political campaign funding show that the vast majority of O&G firms, including Koch Industries, Chevron, and Exxon Mobil, have made substantial donations nearly exclusively to conservative campaigns for over a decade (opensecrets.org). However, these contributions should be considered more as investments than donations, as the corporations are essentially buying influence by keeping up a level of monetary support for the candidates or representatives who they believe will always maintain a course of action and voting that aligns with the company’s financial interests—namely, resisting emissions reduction and green energy policies. (Goldberg et al., 2020). The Republican Party was most likely chosen as the primary target for this lobbying strategy due to their acute attention to and concern with a stable economy. Once again, the strategy highlights the prioritization of financial payoffs on the organizational level and the subsequent perpetuation of disapproval for climate-friendly policies. For the politicians themselves, financial payoff is not as significant of a motivator. Instead, their payoff lies in the power of influence that comes with holding public office. An interesting psychological dilemma which would be worth further research is that of these politicians’ psyches, as they receive their payoff from achieving power and influence, yet must yield virtually all of their personal decision-making power with respect to climate change.\nThe literature behind this lobbying phenomenon is fairly wide but lacks real depth. While there is plenty of data and evidence behind the direction and intention of O&G donations, there is still a significant lack of theorized counter-strategy against this abuse of politics. As it stands now, most literature detailing the political dynamics discussed here serves only as a database of background information and at most promotes public protest and individual activism. There must be advancements in the relevant research in order to find methods of forcing a change in this political structure and achieving widespread sustainable practices before the arrival of a tipping point preceding environmental disaster.\n\n\n7.4.2 International\nCompared to the domestic scene, the game theory of international politics on climate change presents as less corrupt, yet is far more complicated and poses different barriers to achieving policy construction and cooperation. Perhaps the main difference between the two is that the domestic political game is dominated by players with the most money, whereas the international political game is a truer competition where no player can be seen as “in first place,” as they are all engaging in various interactions simultaneously and often have changes of priority. Unfortunately, fossil fuels still stand as the most widely accessible, economy-friendly form of energy nearly everywhere in the world (Gross 2020), so any one country deciding to commit to a real transition to sustainable energy would be at considerable risk of backsliding on the global stage. Game theory can be helpful in identifying the approaches to understanding this issue and reaching for collective decision making.\nFor the purpose of forming coalitions for collective action, game theory identifies two main methods: formation of one grand coalition and formation of many smaller coalitions (Wood 2011). Concerning the grand coalition, essentially every country of the world would be included, creating a massive movement of collective behavior which would effectively guide sustainable practices worldwide. While this seems wonderful at first glance, it would most likely not properly account for the wide variety of conditions and contexts under which these different nations are accustomed to operating. In contrast, the smaller coalitions approach allows for the deployment of multiple different strategies for sustainability, allowing countries of different classifications to join a coalition that fits its profile.\nCurrently, the closest thing to an international coalition to exist is the Kyoto Protocol. This treaty, which was adopted in 1997 and put into effect in 2005, is an international commitment backed by the United Nations which utilizes thorough monitoring and verification systems to ensure the compliance of the 192 nations involved (UNFCCC). While the scale of this agreement is large enough to qualify as the grand coalition type, its policy is not severe or sufficient enough to lead to a complete decline of the climate crisis, which is why it is stable enough to encompass so many nations for as long as it has. While this fact does not mean that the Kyoto Protocol is useless or should be discarded, it emphasizes the difficulty of implementing a highly effective and stable grand coalition, as well as the reasoning for attempting implementation of many smaller coalitions with stricter policies."

    "text": "7.5 Conclusion\nIn conclusion, game theory is a study of economic behavioral analysis which provides many appropriate methods for understanding the various aspects of the climate debate and designing interventions for sustainable behavior. Its base principle of agents choosing payoff-maximizing strategies lends insight to the motivational mechanisms of not only individuals, but also organizations and political systems. On the individual level, both financial and social payoffs incite motivation, but the sticky quality of social norms makes interventions with financial incentives the most promising method for inducing sustainable behaviors. Organizations, particularly large Oil and Gas corporations, operate on similar logic only to a much higher scale of financial payoff, and have used their monetary power over the last few decades to support climate change skepticism and maintain their profits. Finally, those actions from O&G firms have cultivated a domestic political system in the United States that is highly corrupt with regard to climate change discourse and policy, and the study of coalition games informs us of the difficulties of creating collective international sustainable norms. Moving forward, further study of climate change game theory, particularly concerning organizational decision-making and coalition formation, is necessary to identify more realistic methods for achieving long-term sustainability."
