## PART I: A Brief Introduction to Social Identity 

Social identity plays a pivotal role in shaping the lives of individuals. Even before birth, our communities contribute to the formation of our identities, which continue to influence our decisions and actions throughout our lives, including those related to climate issues. In the 1970s, Tajfel and Turner defined social identity theory as \"the part of an individual\'s self-concept that is derived from their membership in various social groups\" (Tajfel & Turner, 1979). Patricia Hills Collins further developed this theory by introducing intersectionality, a critical social theory that examines how individuals\' identities interact and integrate to form a holistic sense of self (Hill Collins, 2019). Due to the intertwined nature of identity, it is challenging to isolate the impact of one element of a person\'s social identity on their behavior. However, within the literature on climate psychology, certain patterns emerge that shed light on how specific group affiliations can result in a wide range of climate-related behaviors.

When discussing social identity, it is important to recognize that identities are not uniformly developed. Social identity theory distinguishes between ascribed identities and avowed identities. Ascribed identities are \"aspects determined at birth over which people had little control\" (Jackson & Hogg, 2010), while avowed identities are those we claim for ourselves (Communication in the Real World, 2016). Examples of ascribed identities include race, assigned sex at birth, ethnicity, social class, and nationality, while avowed identities encompass gender, political affiliation, occupation, and religious beliefs. It is crucial to note that the boundaries between these categories are fluid and have evolved throughout history. For instance, gender, until recently, was predominantly seen as an ascribed identity assigned based on an individual\'s biological sex at birth.

Given the complexity of simultaneously holding multiple identities, the majority of our identities tend to feel insignificant most of the time. Social psychologists use the term \"salience\" to describe the activation of a particular identity. The salience of an identity is determined by factors such as its relevance to the situation and the individual\'s commitment or embeddedness in that identity (Stets & Burke, 231). In other words, for an identity to influence behavior, it must be pertinent to both the person and the specific circumstances. This notion is pertinent to our work as behavior change requires a certain degree of identity salience in order to occur.

In a classic study by Levine et al. Manchester United soccer fans were asked about their team affiliation and love of soccer before being asked to go to another part of the building to complete part two of the study. On their way to the second location they passed a confederate jogger who had supposedly fallen and twisted their ankle. The researchers measured how many participants stopped to help the "injured runner" based on the shirt the confederate was wearing. When they were wearing a Manchester United jersey 92% of participants stopped to help, when they were wearing jersey from Liverpool (the rival team) 30% of participants stopped to help, and when they were wearing a blank t-shirt 33% of participants stopped to help. The increased salience of the Manchester United identity highly impacted their willingness to help a fellow fan (Levine et al., 2005). When it comes to the climate crisis identity salience is a complex challenge, the correct identity must be salient at the correct moment in order to inspire action.

Finally, it is crucial to acknowledge that identities are not static throughout a lifespan. Generally, avowed identities are more resistant to change than ascribed identities, as changes in avowed identities often require external influences. However, considering the fluidity of social norms and the arbitrary boundaries of human categorization, no aspect of identity remains fixed.. Baumeister and Muraven (1996) suggest that adaptation to the sociocultural context is the primary driver of adult identity change. This theory holds significant relevance for climate action, given that the sociocultural context will inevitably undergo transformation due to the changing environmental landscape. As the planet continues to warm, the relevance of the climate crisis will exponentially increase.

The subsequent sections will delve into the influence of specific social identities on climate action and explore how social identity can be harnessed to promote positive climate action.

## PART II: How does social identity impact climate action? 

At the outset it is worth noting and conceding that identities impacts on behavior operate broadly, although there is growing consensus that identity is an important predictor of both climate attitudes and behaviors (Vesely, 2021). However, these two do need to be treated separately. As Vesley et al. observe, identity may be relevant to the study of climate change attitudes in two different ways. Identity may influence the extent to which specific behaviors are *seen* favorably or unfavorably but this might not impact behavior, if associated costs of that behavior are too high. On the other hand, identity *can* influence behavior if the behaviors are interpreted to be self-expressive of individuals\' identities (2021, 2). Both observations have important implications for the study of the psychology of climate change. In the first instance, understanding how to shift perceptions of pro-climate behaviors could have significant political utility, and pro-climate self-expressions could be "crucial when thinking about large-scale climate change mitigation efforts" (Vesley, 2021, 2).

Before diving into the sorts of identities that might be particularly relevant for conversations around climate change advocacy, we examine the pathways through which identity might either impact, (i) an individual\'s actual beliefs around climate change, and (ii) what sorts of actions an individual might be influenced to take or avoid, as a result of identity influenced factors.

First, let us consider the relationship between cognition and belief formation, and identity. There are a number of pathways through which identity might impact cognition. The following section will draw from Kahan et. al and discuss three pathways that we find to be particularly relevant to our subject. The first, is the idea of **identity-protective cognition**, the second are **culturally-informed theories of risk**, and the third is **social domination theory**.

### Pathways for Identity Impacts on Cognition

*Identity-protective cognition*. Identity-protective cognition refers to the tendency of culturally diverse individuals to selectively credit and dismiss evidence in patterns that reflect the beliefs that predominate in their group. According to Dan Kahan, "The basic premise of identity protective cognition is that culture is prior to fact in the apprehension of societal risks" ([[Kahan]{.underline}], 2017, p.2). It is particularly worth noting that these impacts inform not just heuristic thinking but actually (often subconsciously) also inform systematic reasoning; consciously or not, there is credence given to a commonly held belief within one's in-group (Kahan et. al, 2007, p. 470). Wischnewski and Kramer read identity-protection theory and social identity theory together, to suggest that identity-congruent information becomes "identity affirming" (2021, 2) when it affirms particular social identities - specifically, political identity.

*Cultural theory of risk*. Initially proposed by Mary Douglas posits that risk is culturally determined. Douglas offers a grid / group typology that categorizes various individuals' world views scaled from relatively hierarchical-egalitarianism on one axis, and individualistic-communitarianism on the other (Kahan et. al). According to Douglas, individuals with stronger egalitarian and communitarian perspectives are more likely to be attuned to social environmental and technological risks (Kahan et. al, p. 469). A number of key issues are insufficiently explained by this theory. The first would be: the causal mechanisms that would explain why some individuals tend towards hierarchical or conversely egalitarian world views, and similarly, towards individualistic versus communitarianism ones (find citations in the literature that broad cultural positioning is insufficient). The second, and crucially for our purposes, it is not clear that particular orientations would be predictive of actually taking risk-adaptive behavior, so as a theory around climate *action*, further research is needed. Additionally, it is worth noting that in their meta-analysis, Vesely et al. note that individualist-collectivist orientation did not have s significant mediating effect on climate attitudes or behaviors, but concede that this might be the result of place-based biases (most studies included were in so-called "WEIRD" countries) (Vesely et. al., 2021).

*Social domination orientation*. Sometimes stated as the "extent to which one desires that one\'s in-group dominate and be superior to out-groups" (Pratto et al., 1994, p. 726), it can more generally be defined as a preference for the continuation of group-based hierarchies in line with the status quo - even if one's group is *not* the dominant group (Bergh et al., 2019, p. 580).

### Discussion: moving from pathways to feelings and actions

Although significant research exists to explain these pathways, there are a number of questions that remain unanswered with regard to climate relevant identities. The first is whether these cognitive processes sufficiently explain climate change *attitudes*, the second is whether they explain if they can support explanations for whether attitudes drive action - that is to say, do they sufficiently explain climate *behaviors*, and finally, whether these processes are salient across forms of identity and how that overlaps with the sorts of identities that are relevant for predicting climate attitudes and behavior.

#### I. Identity and pro-climate attitudes

To start, let us consider the existing evidence that these cognitive processes do in fact, impact climate *attitudes*. In their meta-analysis, Vesely et al. find "robust positive associations" (2021, 3) between all identities they consider (place identity, connectedness to nature, environmental self-identity and social identity) and climate intentions or in our parlance, attitudes. Across 143 studies, they find the most robust relationship between environmental self-identity and climate attitude, noting that this particular identity is 0.62 correlated with pro-climate attitudes (i.e. intentions to act). They find the weakest relationship between pro-climate attitudes and social identity (r = 0.33) and place identity (r = 0.18). A major limitation of their coding mechanism is that they do not scale the degree or strength of these identities that's required to produce strong positive correlations. It is worth noting that Vesely et al. conduct a bivariate zero-correlation analysis on effect size therefore results are likely overestimated, and the true correlations may be less robust than reported in this study.

Vesley et al. offer only a superficial explanation of the pathway through which these identities might impact climate attitudes but this point is worth dwelling on. These authors offer two hypotheses for how identities impact climate attitudes. The first, as has been discussed, is around self-conception and/or self-expression. The second, is the extent to which an individual views climate as a particularly salient issue for their social identity. Understanding these pathways is important. To the extent that enhancing the salience of pro-climate self-conception or pro-climate social group identification is possible, this observation offers a way to potentially trigger greater pro-climate attitudes. Understanding the *types* of identities that might be relevant can also help manage policy and political interventions, by carefully framing climate messages around particular pro-climate identities e.g. local-level habitat protection might appeal to an environmentalist identity, or to a place-based identity where an individual might be concerned with the long term protection of their home. However, as Vesely et al. note, these interventions must be carefully managed as they also risk compromising individual emotional wellbeing (e.g. through triggering extreme anger or reactivity) (2021, 5).

#### II. Identity and pro-climate behaviors

On the surface, Vesley et al.'s meta-analysis seems to reveal similar results across attitudes and behaviors. As discussed above, they find in a review of 163 studies, that environmental self-identity is once more positively correlated with pro-climate behavior (r = 0.56), and other identities are positively but more weakly correlated. Interestingly, they do find that environmental self-identity is more strongly correlated with pro-climate intentions (attitudes) than it is with pro-climate behaviors, but the reverse relationship is true for the other identities tested (place identity, social identity, and level of "connectedness to nature\").

It is worth starting with the concession that some of this result might be spurious. Although Vesley et al. control for some important cross-paper differences including effect size, categories for independent and dependent variables, and publication bias, at the end of the day, they are constructing a synthetic scale of comparison (each underlying paper had vastly different methodologies) and it is difficult to call this an apples-to-apples comparison.

That being said, what might explain this intention-behavior gap, that's at least suggested, and does it offer any insight on how social identity affects climate [behavior]{.underline}? The literature is not clear on this but offers a number of useful threads. In their analyses, Vesely et al. suggest that at least part of the distance between intention and action, is the perception of the extent to which social norms around a particular identity, require individuals to act in pro-climate ways (2021). In this view, one can imagine that if there's a high degree of friction to action, and pro-climate intentions and attitudes satisfy social membership, there is likely to be inertia around climate action. At the individual level, they also suggest that for some identities, self-expression and action are more tightly connected e.g. if I believe public transportation is an important part of the social fabric, then part of my self-identity will involve *taking* public transportation. However, others offer alternative explanations that might be worth exploring.

There are numerous non-experimental studies exploring the potential mechanisms for belief-action gaps, which tend to cover everything from insufficient information, to cognitive overload, to moral disengagement or distancing (Peeters et al., 2019). There is less empirical work around this question, and it merits further study. However, one interesting finding to consider comes from the work of Salomon, Preston, and Tannenbaum who find: (i) perceptions of climate change efficacy robs individuals of a sense of agency around climate change action, (ii) the resulting sense of helplessness leads individuals to "demoralize" climate action and no longer attach normative value to climate action, and (iii) that this pattern holds true, *regardless* of starting climate change belief and it is perceptions of efficacy, not climate beliefs, that determine whether a person views the taking action as an individual imperative (Salomon et al., 2017). Further research is needed to understand both what accounts for the gap between climate belief and action, and the role of mediators such as perceived efficacy and moralization of climate action. However, if replicated, Salomon et. al's findings offer an exciting advocacy avenue: if advocates can more clearly articulate the story of climate impacts flowing from individual action (everything from home efficiency improvements to political actions), perhaps this could have a generally stimulating impact on pro-climate behavior.

#### III. Which identities?

Finally, it is worth discussing which sorts of identities might be relevant to the study of climate change action. Generally, there is little agreement on what identities are most salient "in predicting climate-related intentions and actual behavior" (Vesely at al, 2021, 2). Similar to Vesely et al., others have found that identities rooted in political positions, values, or ideologies, tend to be more predictive of climate behaviors, with other identities including the ascribed identities like age, race, gender, and even education-level, appear to be more indirect (Hornsey et al., 2016, Whitmarsh, 2011). The following section will explore how these identities mediate climate change belief and/or action.

## PART III: How Specific Identities Relate to Climate Change and Climate Action 

### Identity as an Environmentalist 

The term \"environmentalist\" refers to individuals who are concerned with or advocate for the protection of the environment (Oxford Languages). However, understanding the nuances between someone who is simply concerned and someone who actively advocates becomes crucial when examining this avowed identity in the context of the climate crisis. The label \"environmentalist\" is complex, as it can be perceived both as socially beneficial and harmful, depending on the situation. Due to the moral ambiguity associated with this identity, some people are reluctant to publicly display their affiliation with the environmental movement through collective action.

Like all identities, environmentalism cannot be examined in isolation. The climate crisis has become highly politicized (a topic explored in-depth in section IIIc), leading many individuals to use public displays of environmentalism (or the lack thereof) to signal their political affiliation. Environmentalism is frequently used to display one\'s support for or adherence to certain moral, social, or political values, often in a performative or conspicuous manner, with the intention of gaining social approval. This phenomenon is called virtue signaling and plays an important role in demonstrating social identity. A study conducted by Brick, Sherman, and Kim in 2017 explored this phenomenon and found that \"environmentalist identity predicted pro-environmental behavior more strongly for high-visibility behaviors, controlling for individual-level confounds (attitudes, political identity) and behavior-level factors (difficulty, effectiveness)\" (Brick et al., 226). This influence of social identity on in-group norms and environmental action emphasizes the importance of considering visibility when addressing the climate crisis. While visible actions may engage certain demographics, they may also alienate others, highlighting the need for inclusive approaches to motivate broad and collective climate action.

In a 2014 study by Kashima, Paladino, and Margetts, researchers aimed to unravel the complexities of this social identity by distinguishing between two key elements: environmentalist identity and environmental striving. Environmentalist identity refers to being an environmentally friendly person according to cultural norms, while environmental striving encompasses personal motivations that go beyond these norms. The study found that individuals who identified as environmentalists were likely to engage in green shopping and green talk, whereas environmental strivers were more likely to make personal sacrifices such as driving less, which incurs higher personal costs. The authors acknowledged the limitations of their findings, as their study focused on only three behaviors, but they suggested that further examination of environmental striving\'s impact and cultivation is warranted. As they concluded, \"Whereas mundane environmentalism overlaps greatly with the mainstream of many industrialized (and even industrializing) societies, environmental activism situates itself outside the mainstream and attempts to change the society\... If mundane environmentalism and environmental activism differentiate environmentalism along the political dimension of mainstream vs. activism, environmental striving is agnostic to the political dimension\" (Kashima et al., 73). This finding is an important consideration when analyzing the study below.

In a pre-registered study published in February 2023, researchers explored the distinction between environmental intent and impact among a representative sample of the British public. The study focused on participants\' intentions to take collective climate action and their involvement with Extinction Rebellion (XR). XR defines itself as \"a decentralized, international and politically non-partisan movement using non-violent direct action and civil disobedience to persuade governments to act justly on the Climate and Ecological Emergency\" (What is XR?). The researchers hypothesized that individuals with high collective action intentions (defined as a willingness to perform behaviors such as donating to an environmental cause and posting on social media about their environmental views) and strong social identification with XR would exhibit greater engagement with XR. They predicted that this effect would be mediated by two factors: beliefs about XR\'s collective efficacy and norm perceptions of climate action.

The study\'s outcome variable was whether or not a participant joined XR\'s mailing list and the extent to which they were willing to answer additional questions to \"help XR.\" The majority of participants who agreed to additional questioning answered all five questions, leading the researchers to categorize this secondary measure of behavioral engagement with XR as a binary variable (Parkes et al., 9). The low barrier to entry for this outcome variable raises concerns about the study. The researchers were unable to provide strong support for their initial hypothesis or either of its mediators. However, they did find that the strongest predictor of social identification with XR (but not behavior) was whether or not participants held positive perceptions of XR members (Parkes et al., 17). Participants expressed various opinions about XR, and some criticized the movement for its extreme tactics, causing disruption and misery to ordinary people (Parkes et al., 21). While environmentalism can be used to virtue-signal, many environmentalists have a negative reputation, particularly when associated with extreme tactics employed by groups like XR.

Given the intricate network of virtues associated with an environmentalist identity, many individuals are hesitant to publicly proclaim their affiliation with this social group through collective action. Based on this review of the research, to encourage higher rates of climate action, organizations should encourage higher rates of climate action by adopting a dual strategy which promotes meaningful and private environmental behaviors (such as voting) while dissociating environmentalism from the radical activism associated with high-SES groups such as XR. Instead, it should focus on engaging environmental strivers who are motivated by actions that demonstrate their concern for the climate without necessitating the adoption of an activist identity.

### Political Identity 

Political polarization is far and away the most highly investigated topic when it comes to group identity and the climate crisis. The climate crisis has become highly politicized within developed countries, with the left perceiving it as an urgent matter demanding unwavering attention, while the right tends to downplay or even deny climate change. However, this stark division was not always so apparent. In the scholarly literature, climate change initially emerged as a scientific issue around 1970, remaining separate from political affiliations for the following two decades. It was only in the mid-1990s that climate change became a polarizing topic. Over the past 30 years, polarization regarding climate change has been rapidly increasing (see Chinn et al. for an in-depth discussion of this topic). Overcoming these entrenched political divides is crucial if we hope to address the climate crisis effectively.

Research on politics and climate primarily falls into two categories: partisan identity and political affiliation. Partisan identity refers to the group-level process of aligning politically with other members of one\'s community, while political ideology indicates an individual\'s position on the political spectrum, irrespective of their group identity. A 2017 meta-analysis investigated how the interaction between these factors shapes an individual\'s climate opinions. The analysis concluded that "the strengthening relationship between political affiliation and environmental concern is due primarily to partisan sorting, rather than to issue polarization on environmental issues" (Cruz, 2017). This finding is encouraging for the environmental movement since it suggests that changing the stance of a political party may be sufficient over changing the minds of individuals. If a small number of influential conservative voices within the Republican party were to express meaningful concern about the climate crisis, it could potentially shift the tide and lead to the passage of important policies.

Regrettably, until recently, much of the literature on political polarization and climate change has focused on individual-level processes. Nonetheless, several noteworthy findings from this research deserve examination, particularly those related to the salience of partisan identities and downplaying their significance. As discussed in the introduction to this chapter, saliency plays a critical role in social identity. If an identity is not salient to us, it is unlikely to significantly impact our decisions or actions at a given moment. An Australian paper published in 2014 demonstrated the meaningful impacts of saliency on climate belief and action, "perceived human contribution to climate change was significantly lower for people who identified with the right-wing of politics and whose political identity was made salient (64.4%) than those people who identified with the right-wing of politics but whose political identity was not made salient (40.5%) (F(1,102) = 13.48, p \< .001)" (Unsworth & Fielding, 2014). It is striking to note that a mere difference in saliency resulted in a more than 20% difference in beliefs. Given the extreme level of polarization, this 20% can meaningfully influence policy. Additionally, if 20% of an ingroup shifts their opinion, it may serve as a catalyst for the remainder of the group to follow suit. With this in mind, the research turns to another crucial question: how can we de-emphasize political identities and uplift other aspects of an individual\'s identity?

Several studies have attempted to address this question. A 2020 study found that among Republican parents, receiving a message about the impact of climate change on future generations increased their climate change concern and intended pro-climate political behaviors. However, this framing effect disappeared when a partisan identity was primed before the message (Diamond, 2020). Interestingly, the effect did not hold for Democratic parents; they needed to be primed with their Democratic identity prior to their parental identity to observe a meaningful shift in pro-climate behaviors. The researchers hypothesize two reasons for this backfiring effect. The first is that a focus on the future may make the crisis seem less urgent (i.e. it will impact my children's children and not my children, therefore my direct level of concern is lower). The second reason is known as the "trump effect." Given the timeline of the study the researchers were able to watch Democratic parents lose faith in the efficacy of their political actions pre- and post-Donald Trump's election in 2016. The backfire effect may be due to "a reduction in perceived effectiveness of political action on climate change after the change in presidential administration in 2017" (Diamond, 1145). Unfortunately, there is no foolproof method to predict or prevent such backfiring, which is why individual interventions targeting identity salience should be approached cautiously.

The next consideration is what can and should be done to leverage group-level political affiliations. Based on a recently published review of the literature the most promising suggestions seem to be "correcting misperceptions of social norms, and...having trusted leaders---whether political elites, other elites, or experts--- communicate about climate change" (Schulte et al., 2020). These approaches rely on combating something known as pluralistic ignorance within the Republican party concerning the climate crisis. Pluralistic ignorance is a situation in which a person thinks that their privately held beliefs are contrary to the majority's beliefs, when in actuality the majority also holds the same beliefs. The majority is individually afraid to openly oppose a norm because it appears that everyone else agrees with it, so the widely unsupported norm continues. When it comes to Republican concern surrounding the climate crisis, the utilization of a few key political figures within the Republican party and a leveraging of salient non-political identities (such as parenthood) have the potential to significantly alter the party\'s beliefs on the subject.

Although the polarization of the climate crisis has been portrayed as a negative occurrence thus far, the prioritization of group identity over personal beliefs may ultimately facilitate rapid change. By highlighting non-political identities relevant to the climate crisis, challenging social norms rooted in misconceptions about the reality of global warming, and leveraging the voices of influential political leaders within the Republican party, we have the potential to significantly reduce climate change polarization. The critical question that needs to be addressed moving forward is how to incentivize the aforementioned steps.

### Racial and Cultural Identity

#### Overview -- unpacking the role of race, and culture in climate change research

In closing, we discuss existing research between ascribed, stable social identities and climate change. For the purposes of this discussion, we focus primarily on racial and cultural identity. In part because these demographic dimensions tend to be generally underrepresented in the literature on climate change (Salil Benegal et al., 2022), with a lot of the empirical work reviewed in this volume, instead focusing on age, educational status, socio-economic status, and gender.

As discussed in the preceding section of this chapter, researchers have generally found that demographic identities are less likely to be *directly* predictive of climate change attitudes. However, it is worth exploring the research that does exist liking demographic identities to climate change attitudes for at least three reasons. The first, is that demographic identities are likely to be highly correlated with, if not causally influence characteristics like political identity (84% of Black voters and 63% of Latino voters are registered Democrats (Pew Research Center, 2018)), or identity as an environmentalist (e.g. through strong place-based ties). The second, is that it is reasonable to believe that demographic identities, and in particular, race and culture, would have impact different characteristics identified in earlier chapters as being correlated with climate change behavior or belief (e.g. levels of social trust, risk perception, social norms, perceived behavioral control, identification with nature). Finally, demographic factors may influence dynamics that determine climate change attitudes, that have not been extensively covered in this volume, such as subjective adaptive capacity (which refers to the ability of an individual, or a community, to adapt to the impacts of climate change) (Fresque-Baxter & Armitage, 2012).

Before reviewing available findings, it is worth noting that overall, the relationship between climate change beliefs and racial or cultural identities, generally merits significantly more study (Salil Benegal et al., 2022). Much of the empirical work in climate change, draws from survey pools that are not nationally representative and generally, have predominantly white recipient pools (Rode et. al, 2021). Secondly, much of the empirical work on climate change tends to focus on climate change [beliefs]{.underline} but some scholars have found evidence that racial differences may be more pronounced with respect to attitudes towards climate change [policy]{.underline}. With these general limitations in mind, it is important to read the highlighted findings below with reasonable skepticism, and perhaps consider the following discussion as offering a series of starting points for more comprehensive research on the relationship between racial and cultural identities, and climate change attitudes and beliefs.

#### Key findings in literature on race, cultural identity, and climate change attitudes

**Existing research suggests that the climate change attitudes are less polarized among non-White groups.** Schuldt et al.(2016) ran a OLS regression analysis on survey data from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel survey and found that conservative ideology was almost twice as predictive of climate change personal belief (*b~white~ = -.52, b~non-white~ = -0.28*)[^1] likelihood of perceiving scientific consensus on the issue (interaction between political ideology and perception of consensus Whites: χ2 (1351) = 204.16, versus non-Whites: χ2 (661) = 44.97), and supporting government intervention for Whites than non-Whites. Perhaps most significantly for the purposes of our discussion, Schuldt et. al - building off prior work that observed non-White liberals are less likely to identify as environmentalists due to perceived barriers to entry and low levels of acceptance in environmental groups (Taylor 2007, 2014) - also found that non-White liberals were significantly less likely to identify as environmentalists (71.8% of White liberals, versus 53.8% of non-White liberals identified as environmentalists).[^2] Considering this, it is worth further study to understand how the attitude and behavioral effects associated with identity as an environmentalist, vary among non-Whtie groups. These findings were reinforced in a larger dataset, in a cross-sectional analysis of US national polling data between 2008 - 2019 (Ballew et. al, 2021). Ballew et. al. find that in general, people of color "have significantly greater levels of acceptance that global warming is happening, and higher global warming risk perceptions than Whites" (Ballew et. al, 2021, 3). It is worth noting that Ballew et al. did find that issue polarization on climate change increased over time across all groups, in the decade the survey was repeated, although polarization effects remained consistently weaker among people of color than Whites.

**It is possible that non-White populations have higher rates of climate change belief and higher levels of risk perception surrounding climate change.** This observation is drawn from Teyton and Abramson's work, which studied climate change attitudes among Hurricane Katrina survivors. Teyton and Abramson (2021) found exposure to Hurricane Katrina and recent flooding events and hurricanes had positive associations with climate change beliefs (OR: 8, and OR: 5.2 respectively). However white individuals (across cohorts e.g. less educated vs more educated) had significant negative associations with climate change belief (OR: 0.2). It is worth noting that the odds' ratios across outcomes do not represent large-sized effects. Nonetheless, Teyton and Abramson found that race was found to be the only significant variable among Katrina survivors that impacted climate change belief (also tested were income, age, gender, education, influence of news and science reports, influence of friends and family). The study concludes that findings reflect the fact that among this population (Katrina survivors), race was a strong predictor of level of exposure to damage, as well as ability to recover, explaining heightened risk. As the number of climate related natural disasters' increases risk exposure and racial dynamics merit further study.

**Additional studies suggest room compelling further research on the relationship between additional socio-demographic categories and climate attitudes.** The studies reviewed so far in this section leave a lot on the table with respect to racial and cultural determinants of climate attitudes. First, they do not sufficiently explore [why]{.underline} some of the determinants we've explored through this volume (e.g. identity as an environmentalist) differ between racial or cultural identity. Second, they narrowly focus on race in a binary construction (White versus non-White), and do not explore different group dynamics within non-White communities that might warrant study. And finally, they tend not to consider additional socio-demographic conditions that might impact climate attitudes. However, there is available work that hints at the productive possibilities that further exploring some of these questions might open up.

For instance, Pearson et. al, find that political ideology is not a robust predictor of climate attitudes among Latinos, but *familism* - a "relational value reflecting a strong attachment to family and prioritization of family over self" (2021, p. 11) - is. The study runs an OLS regression for both belief and policy support on Ipsos KnowledgePanel survey data, and finds that familism significantly predicted belief certainty (b = 0.49), policy support (b = 0.33) and perceived scientific consensus (b = 0.34) among Latinos. Interestingly, their model found that *no other variables*, including political ideology, was a significant predictor of climate attitudes for this sample. This study should be read with a degree of skepticism. Although Hispanic and Latino respondents were oversampled, the overall size of the sample was small (n = 202) and the only analytical tool deployed was OLS, so it is possible that the effect size is, in truth, likely far smaller than the headline finding suggests. That being said, this study hints at an interesting avenue for further research: it is possible that the relevant individual and behavioral predictors we've suggested, may potentially need to be nuanced by socio-demographic category.

Another interesting and more unique study in Australia, studied the impact of religious identity on climate belief. Morrison et al., (2015) find that overall, religious affiliation was a far weaker predictor of climate attitudes than other socio-demographic indicators like age, education level, or race. However, in an ordinal regression model that controlled for attitudes and other socio-demographics, being Buddhist had a significant but small effect on the level of climate change concern. It would not be prudent to draw too large a conclusion from this study but it does prompt a discussion around the potential relationship between religious adherence and values that might impact climate change attitudes that have been discussed throughout this volume.
